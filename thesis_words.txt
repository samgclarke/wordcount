Economic viability of small-scale fisheriesbyAnna Christina Schuhbauer
IntroductionMillions of people depend on fisheries resources for food and livelihoods (Pauly et al. 2005; Béné 2006; FAO 2014). The global oceans, however, are threatened by climate change, overfishing and pollution, which jeopardizes biodiversity, food security and the well-being of coastal communities across the world (Cheung et al. 2009; Srinivasan et al. 2010; Rice and Garcia 2011; Sumaila et al. 2011; McClanahan et al. 2013). Solutions have been proposed such as reducing harmful fisheries subsidies, the implementation of marine protected areas and management of fisheries through ecosystem based approaches (Mora et al. 2009; Fulton et al. 2014; Edgar et al. 2014; Sumaila et al. 2015; Christensen et al. 2015; Sumaila et al. 2016). The United Nations has recognized the threats and the need to act, and current sustainable development goals have been agreed upon. These include targets such as reducing illegal fishing, protecting marine biodiversity and supporting small-scale fisheries. Also, providing access to natural resources and markets has been identified as a target especially for small-scale fisheries as they are known to be the most threatened and often economically marginalized. To be able to accomplish these targets, more research needs to be carried out that can be used efficiently for policy makers on local, national and global levels. Objective and research questionsSmall-scale fisheries (SSF) worldwide are known to contribute largely to the livelihoods of coastal communities and poverty alleviation. However, they are economically and politically marginalized as well as understudied. To help rectify their marginalization and bring them to the attention of fisheries policy makers, I argue understanding their economic viability is a vital step. My research objective, therefore, is to assess the economic viability of small-scale fisheries by computing net benefits to society and considering socio-economic attributes. To be able to carry this out the following research questions will be addressed in this thesis:  How is economic viability of SSF understood and defined? What role do fisheries subsidies play for the economic viability of small-scale compared to large-scale fisheries? What are the net benefits from SSF to society compared to the private sector? What role do socio-economic attributes play in the economic viability of SSF? What recommendations can be made for policies towards improving the economic viability of fisheries?Small-scale fisheriesMarine fisheries are estimated to contribute about 240 billion USD to the world economy, based on direct, indirect and induced impacts (Dyck and Sumaila 2010). However, global fisheries are known to be underperforming, mainly due to overfishing (Sumaila et al. 2012). According to the FAO, over 90% of the 4.36 million vessels active in the world can be classified as small-scale fisheries (SSF). Teh and Sumaila (2013) also estimated that SSF support up to 22 million fishers, who make up about 44% of all fishers in the primary production sector. Furthermore, Béné et al. (2007) report that an additional 100 million people are involved in the post-harvest sector of SSF. Defining small-scale fisheriesThe definition of SSF (including artisanal and subsistence fisheries) is based on many different criteria and SSF are often perceived to be fisheries which are using low technologically advanced gears, and whose products are usually for their own households and/or sold locally (FAO et al. 2008; Pomeroy and Andrew 2011). Categories dividing a country's or a region's fishery into large- and small-scale are often relative i.e., small-scale in one region might be considered large-scale in another. However, despite SSF being such a contextual term, there is also some common ground found in these fisheries. They are facing similar problems and threats; some of which are: low economic performance, inability for SSF fishing communities to retain most of the benefits from their fisheries; relatively high incidence of poverty and undernourishment in certain SSF communities and pressure from globalization, industrialization as well as global change such as climate change. In addition to these challenges, ineffective management and the under-representation of local stakeholders in decision making processes have contributed to the marginalization of SSF (Béné 2003; Béné et al. 2010b; Chuenpagdee 2011; Allison et al. 2012; Lam et al. 2012). The often unorganized nature of small-scale fisheries makes them difficult to monitor and consequently they are often undervalued and most SSF exist in a data-poor condition (Pauly 1997; Zeller et al. 2006; Andrew et al. 2007).They are found to be fisheries which tend to be tied to their local communities, reflecting their traditions and value (FAO et al. 2008; Pomeroy and Andrew 2011). However, even though currently no generally acceptable global definition exists (see e.g., (Sumaila et al. 2001) for an attempt), I decided for this thesis to therefore use each country's definition from which we obtained the data. For example, Tanzanian small-scale fisheries are defined by the FAO as follows (FAO 2007): “All artisanal fisheries in marine waters take place within the territorial waters (12 nautical miles stretch). The catch consists mostly of fin fish, and to a small extent, shrimps. It is dominated by the artisanal fishers using poor crafts and fishing methods.” Another example from Ukraine: “The Ukrainian coastal fisheries consist of two main commercial sectors: artisanal (small-scale) and industrial (large-scale). The artisanal sector is characterized by small boats averaging 4-5 m in length, which use passive fishing gear such as set traps (‘stavniki’) and fixed nets.” (Ulman et al. 2015). In the case where no national definition was found for the small-scale or artisanal fishing sector, I have adopted the definition which the Sea Around Us has used for their fisheries reconstruction and combined artisanal and subsistence sectors. The definition is as follows: SSF are fisheries, which operate in domestic waters, within their country's EEZ, maximum 50 km off the coast or 200 m depth and include both commercial and non-commercial fisheries (Pauly and Zeller 2015, 2016).Too Big To Ignore – small-scale fisheries researchToo Big To Ignore (TBTI) is a global research and knowledge mobilization partnership established to elevate the profile of SSF, to argue against their marginalization in national and international policies, and to develop research and governance capacity to address global fisheries challenges (http://toobigtoignore.net/). This PhD project, as part of this global initiative, focusses on strengthening the knowledge base of SSF with the main objective of defining and assessing the current economic viability of SSF. The following section and chapters of this thesis will demonstrate what economic viability means, why its assessment will bring attention and understanding to the existing problems encountered by these fisheries and why economic viability is fundamental to help prepare SSF to withstand the barrage of threats they face.Economic viabilityAny economic system has to adapt to scarcity constraints and be balanced between supply and demand for the system to function viably (Aubin 2011). The goal of most economic entities is profitability, the higher the profit, the better is the entity's status. A private entity is therefore considered 'financially viable' when its profit is positive. However, when considering economic viability, I refer not only to the sole profit of a private individual (or a private entity) but also to the whole society or the public sector, such that economic viability is accomplished when net benefit of an activity to society is non-negative.Often, measures such as the return on investment (net cashflow/investment) are used as an indicator to judge about a system's economic performance. Profit is necessary for a system to be economically viable, but it is not necessarily the sole measurement, particularly since a profitable system today may not be so tomorrow (Tisdell 1996; Baumgärtner and Quaas 2009). Additionally, SSF are often considered as fisheries tied to their cultural values and traditions where the goal for the participants is not always just profit (Kronen 2004; Pollnac and Poggie 2008; Hospital and Beavers 2012; Berkes et al. 2012). The term viability, describes the long term survival of a system, and especially for SSF measuring the pure financial performance of the fishery does not provide enough information to determine whether the fishery can be considered economically viable or not. Measuring economic viability of SSF is therefore quite challenging as it goes beyond assessing only the financial situation and other economic aspects need to be taken into account, such as for example subsidies. Attributes of economic viabilityUsing attributes to measure the state of a fishery is a common technique used for a variety of goals, including assessing the sustainability of a fishery. For example, attributes were identified and used to describe and understand different SSF in Europe (Guyader et al. 2013). In Brazil, an analysis was performed using socio-economic indicators to assess and compare the performance of different fishing fleets for ecosystem-based management (Gasalla et al. 2010). In the context of marine protected areas, Edgar et al. (2014) identified five key attributes that need to be considered in order to optimize conservation outcomes. Finally, a study by Fulton et al. (2005) shows how ecological attributes can detect the effects of fishing on marine ecosystems. Based on these experiences and other examples, I use attributes as the foundation of my methods to assess economic viability of SSF. While maintaining a comprehensive view this thesis focuses on assessing the key components affecting economic viability, using economic and socio-economic attributes. At the same time other partners and contributors of the TBTI network of SSF research will address and focus their work on governance, livelihoods, rights, stewardship and ecosystem aspects of small-scale fisheries, which in the broader sense can also affect the economic viability of a fishery. Main attributes describing and defining economic viability will be explored in detail in the following research chapters. However, for a first overview, I will describe the core economic attributes briefly here, which are total revenue, total costs and fisheries subsidies.Total revenueTotal revenue from fishing is equal to the fisheries total landed value and is computed by multiplying ex-vessel prices with tonnes of landed catch. Ex-vessel prices are defined as the price that a fisher receives at the dock for selling the catch (Sumaila et al. 2007). Total costsSubsidiesSubsidies, in addition to total revenue from fishing and total cost, are the main attribute of economic viability. When calculating the net benefits for a single fishing unit, subsidies received by the unit are added to the net benefit as the individual directly benefits from the government support. In the case of net benefits to society, on the other hand, the subsidies are subtracted because tax payers (who form the society) foot the bill. Fisheries subsidies are defined based on Sumaila et al. (2010) as financial transfers, which can be direct or indirect, from public entities to the fishing sector. Subsidies, therefore, help the fishing sector to make more profit than it would otherwise. It should be noted that subsidies are divided into different categories; subsidies that enhance revenues or reduce fishing costs lead to an increase in profit and are therefore capacity-enhancing (Sumaila et al. 2010, 2016). Subsidies that support marine resource conservation and sustainable management, on the other hand, are considered beneficial (Milazzo 1998; Sumaila et al. 2010). The different categories have different impacts on society. One of the main contributors to the global fisheries crisis has been identified as capacity-enhancing fisheries subsidies, which are known to exacerbate overcapitalization of fishing fleets (Pauly et al. 2002; Sumaila et al. 2010, 2012; Guyader et al. 2013).Socio-economics of small-scale fisheriesStudying economics, especially macroeconomics, of fisheries is important for understanding how to to maximize the potential of a fish stock to generate wealth and contribute to social welfare (Cunningham et al. 2009). Despite their importance often being overlooked, small-scale fisheries contribute to food security, trade and economic activity in many countries (Béné 2006; Béné et al. 2007; Chuenpagdee 2011; Harper et al. 2013). To better validate how economic and socio-economic drivers of small-scale fisheries contribute to their economic viability, I will, furthermore, integrate the following attributes into this study: the distribution of net benefits, economic impact of fishing (multiplier), cost structure, employment and employment types, degree of economic dependence on fishing, fisheries discards and the use of fisheries products. These attributes will broaden the approach presented in section 1.3.3 to learn more about the underlying drivers of economic viability.  Thesis overviewThis thesis contains four main research chapters (succeeding chapter 1, the introduction), which together address the objective and research questions (section 1.1) to define and assess economic viability of small-scale fisheries (SSF), succeeded by the concluding chapter. Chapter 2 is a critical literature review about economic viability, where I explore how economic viability is currently defined and assessed in relation to SSF in the literature. In chapter 3, I estimate fisheries subsidies, to small- and large-scale fisheries on a global scale. Fisheries subsidies is the one attribute that accounts for the difference between financial and economic viability (see 1.3). To compute economic viability as net benefits to society, Mexico was chosen as an example, which is covered in chapter 4. Here, I compare economic viability to financial viability for both small- and large-scale fisheries over time on a national level.In chapter 5, I study the impact of socio-economic attributes on economic viability of Mexican small- and large-scale fisheries. The focus lies on the wider impact of fishing on the economy, dependency on fishing, food security, distribution of net benefits, just to name a few. Finally, results reported in earlier chapters will be discussed and conclusions drawn in chapter 6. Furthermore, recommendation will be made on how economic viability of SSF can be improved. Management and policy recommendations will be aimed at contributing to the resilience of small-scale fisheries to large processes of change by increasing their economic viability.This thesis research is exclusively on marine fisheries, as there is still not enough data available at a global level to be able to include freshwater and recreational fisheries into the assessments. However, I recommend using the methods, developed in this project, to assess freshwater fisheries as a next step, as most freshwater fisheries can be considered small-scale and especially in Africa and Asia, they make up large percentages of total fisheries (FAO 2014).  Economic viability and small-scale fisheries – a reviewIntroductionMarine fisheries play a crucial economic, social and cultural role globally; they support human well-being through employment in fishing, processing, and retail services (Pontecorvo et al. 1980; Dyck and Sumaila 2010; FAO 2014) as well as food security (Srinivasan et al. 2010). However, global fisheries are known to be underperforming, mainly due to overfishing, harmful subsidies and over capacity (e.g., (Sumaila et al. 2010).  Small-scale fisheries (SSF) constitute a substantial component of global fisheries, however, they are found to be understudied as well as politically and economically marginalized (Pauly 1997; Allison and Ellis 2001; Chuenpagdee 2011). I argue that understanding how to make SSF more economically viable is very relevant as it will bring attention and understanding to the existing problems encountered by these fisheries. Here, I ask the question: how can economic viability analysis of SSF facilitate a resource management approach that comprehensively takes into account the ecosystem, social, economic and institutional attributes of SSF. The current article, therefore, critically reviews the usefulness of current economic viability analyses of SSF. The goal is to examine how economic viability is currently defined and what approaches have been applied to analyze it in relation to SSF. Further objectives for this study are to (i) identify gaps in the assessments presented herein; and (ii) present recommendations on what could be done to possibly improve the way economic viability of SSF has been defined and applied in the past. I suggest that this can help to improve policies for managing small scale fisheries.According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), over 90% of the 4.36 million fishing vessels active in the world can be classified as small-scale (FAO, 2014). Teh and Sumaila (2013) also estimated that SSF support up to 22 million fishers, who make up about 44% of all fishers in the primary production sector. An additional 100 million people are involved in the post-harvest sector of SSF (Béné et al. 2007). Furthermore, Béné et al. (2010a) estimated the value of the labor-buffer function of the world’s SSF to be US$ 61 billion annually. This amount supports the livelihoods of many fishers in fishing communities with few employment opportunities. SSF, therefore, perform a very important function as an employer of last resort, which if not regulated can in turn result in fish stock depletion (Sumaila 2012).Small-scale fisheries, which here include artisanal and subsistence, are often perceived to be fisheries using low technology or less advanced gears. Another characteristic of SSF identified in the literature is that their products are mostly for household consumption and/or sold in local markets within the fishing community (Chuenpagdee et al. 2006; FAO et al. 2008; Guyader et al. 2013). However, many SSF today are able to employ more advanced gear that can move further away from the ports, and increasingly, they have access to a broader range of markets due to the availability of storage and transport facilities at lower costs (Pomeroy and Andrew 2011). Furthermore, characteristics dividing a region's fishery into large- or small-scale are often relative, i.e., small-scale in one region might be considered large-scale in another (Smith 1979; Berkes et al. 2001; FAO 2003; FAO et al. 2008). However, despite the fact that the definition of SSF is contextual, there is much common ground found in what constitute these fisheries. For example, SSF are often tied to their local communities, reflecting their traditions and values (FAO et al. 2008; Pomeroy and Andrew 2011). Additionally, SSF face the same or at least very similar problems and threats: low economic performance; inability for SSF fishing communities to retain most of the benefits from their fisheries; relatively high incidence of poverty and pressure from globalization and global challenges such as climate change (Chuenpagdee et al. 2006; Zeller et al. 2006; Lam et al. 2012; Harper et al. 2013). In addition to these challenges, poor governance (Sumaila 2012), ineffective management and the under-representation of local stakeholders in decision making processes have contributed to the marginalization of SSF (Pauly 1997; Allison and Ellis 2001; Béné 2003; Béné et al. 2010b; Chuenpagdee 2011; Béné and Friend 2011). Therefore, for the purposes of this study, I focus on the common characteristics of SSF and on how they have been categorized for each study I reviewed.The main reason for critically reviewing the intersection of SSF and economic viability is that SSF research clearly needs more attention, especially, in regard to the social dimension. Analyzing economic viability by applying viability theory (a mathematical method based on viability kernel developed in Aubin, 1991) has been the dominant approach to date for the study of how economically viable small scale fisheries are. Contributions that have applied this approach to consider social, ecosystem, economic and institutional dimensions in their study of SSF include Cissé et al. (2015) and Hardy et al. (2013).Economic ViabilityDefining Economic ViabilityAccording to the Webster 2nd edition 20th century Dictionary, viability is: “The state or quality of being viable (i.e. able to live) and the state of being able to survive under conditions of wide geographical distribution, as species of animals and plants”. This definition is also used to describe the viability of artificial systems, entities and ideas, which have to maintain themselves in the long term to survive. Viability theory studies dynamical systems that capture viability and uses algorithms to describe and model them. The future of these complex and diverse systems is uncertain due to many variables and frequent changes that cannot be easily determined. It is necessary to understand how the dynamic system and the constraints it faces function to be able to restore its viability when problems arise (Aubin 2011). Viability kernel analysis (Krawczyk et al. 2013), has been adapted for use in modeling the dynamics of renewable resource systems under scenarios of uncertainty (Béné and Doyen 2000; Béné et al. 2001; Baumgärtner and Quaas 2009; Doyen et al. 2013).Variables that describe biological and/or social systems can evolve in many different ways which can be deterministic or stochastic; they, however, have the purpose to always adapt to their environment (Aubin 2011). For example, any economic system has to adapt to scarcity constraints and it needs to find a balance between supply and demand to be able to function (Aubin 2011). According to Aubin et al. (2011), the environment is described by different types of variables and that some of those variables must obey specific constraints that can never be violated. Constraints are restrictions that are applied to a given system, they can, for example, be economical, biological or social. The strength of viability theory therefore is that it involves interdisciplinary investigations, meaning it spans across fields, which have traditionally developed in isolation (Aubin 2011).To fully comprehend the term 'economic viability ', the economic part of it also needs to be clearly understood. The term 'economic viability' has been used in many different contexts in the literature without being explicitly defined (Ehui and Spencer 1993; Lery et al. 1999; Barclay and Cartwright 2007; Yazdani and Gonzalez 2007; Adeogun et al. 2009). Here, I combine the concept of economics with viability and focus on how an economic entity (e.g. a small scale fishing enterprise) can survive in the long term. To be able to understand economic viability, therefore, the system's variables and constraints need to be identified (Aubin 1991; Baumgärtner and Quaas 2009; Doyen et al. 2012). Constraints in this case could be, for example, that the system's net benefits to society need to be nonnegative.In the following paragraph, I provide a selected review of how economic viability is described in the context of natural resource exploitation and more specifically fisheries (Table 1). Lery et al. (1999) and Adeogun et al. (2009) analyzed and compared economic viability of fisheries in the sense of pure financial performance based on financial indicators, which typically include net cash flow divided by the sum of total earnings and returns on investment (net cash flow/investment). These indicators are then used to compare the economic viability of different fisheries or a threshold can be set, which has to be exceeded for the fishery to be considered economically viable (Adeogun et al., 2009; Lery et al., 1999). Economic performance, another term often used, measures how well the economic entity is doing currently, as opposed to evaluating it over time. It is argued that economic viability, on the other hand, should not only address the momentary economic performance of an economic entity but also consider its future performance (Tisdell 1996). Tisdell (1996), therefore, points out that the most important step in assessing viability is the consideration of time, as an economic entity needs to be profitable not only today but also in the future. Therefore, cost benefit analysis is often seen as a good tool to determine how economically viable an entity is as it incorporates the time aspect into the assessment of net benefits (Tisdell, 1996). When assessing natural resource exploitation, e.g., by fisheries, it is essential to also consider an intergenerational equity perspective, meaning I should account for the ability of future generations to also be able to benefit from the use of these resources in the future (Sumaila and Walters 2005; Doyen and Martinet 2012; Ekeland et al. 2015).Baumgärtner and Quaas (2009) argue that a dynamic system, such as a fishery, is viable when its different components and functions remain stable, an indication that they will exist with sufficiently high probability into the future. The authors also specify that viability should be a normative criterion for any ecological-economic system. Furthermore, economic viability must provide the basis of strong sustainability under conditions of uncertainty, which means maintaining natural capital stocks and ecosystem services separately. In most models, a level of certainty of the system's future is assumed in order to simulate fluctuations and outcomes. However, using viability kernel analysis makes it possible to endogenously model the system's uncertainties (Béné et al. 2001; Baumgärtner and Quaas 2009; Doyen et al. 2013).

To determine whether a fishery is economically viable, uncertainties need to be dealt with in the most realistic way possible. Only by handling the uncertainties in a model appropriately, can I find out how the fishery system will perform in the future.Béné et al. (2001), Doyen and Péreau (2012) and Gourguet et al. (2013), adjust the classical dynamic fishery model, which focusses on sustainable fisheries and rent maximization by using a viability theory framework (see section 2.1). The goal of this approach is to assess the system's dynamics and its constraints. Controls can then be determined to ensure that the necessary constraints are not violated.  Béné et al. (2001) state that economic viability is reached when the bio-economic system is found in good health. The authors attempted to find instantaneous and simultaneous criteria that would help ensure viability. The article focusses on the viability of the system in crisis situations, meaning that the higher its viability the better it can handle crises. However, while this approach is highly relevant to the concept of economic viability, it is very specifically related to a crisis situation in regard to the bio-economic system rather than to the general state of the system's economic viability. Béné and Doyen (2000) sought to improve the economic viability of the fishery by introducing fish storage capacities to the system, which protects fishers from hazards of market fluctuations. With storage facilities in place, the fishery is less vulnerable to crisis situations thereby making the fishery economically viable (Béné and Doyen 2000). Viability theory has been applied to assess the sustainability of different fisheries management frameworks (Eisenack 2003; Gourguet et al. 2013; Maynou 2014). Eisenack (2003) defines viability criteria in terms of biological and economic thresholds. The management scheme is considered viable when the thresholds set are not exceeded. Thresholds are commonly known as limit reference points (e.g. Maximum Sustainable Yield) in fisheries management. Similarly, Gourguet et al. (2013) and Maynou, (2014) applied the viability theory framework to test and compare fisheries management strategies and recommend them based on their potential usefulness to policy makers. Here, the trade-offs between conflicting objectives in mixed fisheries and the necessary constraints are based on both ecological and economic aspects. Doyen and Péreau (2012) deals with cooperative fisheries management and how viability theory comes into play when assessing the compatibility between bio-economic constraints and an exploited common stock dynamic. This model considers present and future states of the exploited renewable resource system, and the conditions and coalitions under which it can fulfill both profitability and conservation objectives. This is an example germane to trans-boundary stocks that are managed by different legal entities, and presents an interesting and useful alternative to standard game theory models (Sumaila 1999; Bailey et al. 2010). Péreau et al. (2012) show how this approach can be used to assess the sustainability of quota systems of fisheries. The main focus, however, of the above examples is not on the overall economic viability of the fishery but instead directed more specifically at the management strategies aiming for ecological-economic or bio-economic viability.Economic viability of small-scale fisheries (SSF)Small-scale fisheries need to be treated somewhat differently when assessing financial viability or economic performance because, as argued in many studies, the goal of small scale fishers does not always seem to be just profit but also includes traditional, cultural and social values (Berkes et al. 2001; Pollnac et al. 2001; Kronen 2004; Pollnac and Poggie 2008; Trimble and Johnson 2013). Often, large proportions of the catch of SSF are for home consumption (Hospital and Beavers, 2012), and fishing is considered a way of life rather than a profit-orientated business (Kronen, 2004). For example, Hospital and Beavers (2012) found that for the majority of fishers in the Hawaiian bottomfish fishery, cultural aspects outweigh any economic prospects, and although the majority of fishers can cover some of their costs, their main income comes from other activities. Because of these additional considerations, the assessment of economic viability is more challenging as many variables that are not based on financial values need to be considered, making pure quantitative approaches insufficient to fully understand and capture the fishery's dynamics (Martinet et al. 2007; Adeogun et al. 2009; Kronen et al. 2010). Furthermore, it is important to note that using a bio-economic model to assess a fishery requires a large amount of data to be successful. It is known that efforts, especially in SSF, are often not sufficient to collect enough data to carry out an integrated bio-economic fishery assessment (Charles 1991). This disadvantage, therefore, tremendously increases the challenge of constructing comprehensive bio-economic models of these data-poor fisheries.Kronen (2004) illustrates another challenge, i.e., the assumption that prices change influenced by national and international market fluctuations, which is often made when assessing the economics of fisheries, does not necessarily apply to SSF. This study explains that prices stay at levels at which friends and families are able to pay. Prices can therefore be much lower or higher in local markets than in national, regional or international markets. This is particularly the case in low income communities (Kronen, 2004). Considering that this is an observation specific to the fishing community studied in the cited paper, it is still good to show one of many variables and drivers that should be paid attention to when studying SSF. Therefore, when assessing economic viability of a small-scale fishery, it is of high importance to learn about the underlying social dynamics of that fishery and its community rather than focusing on a few selected variables only.The challenge to assessing economic viability has been tackled through approaches such as the viability kernel analysis described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, which gives a decent foundation to an analytical framework and addresses natural resource management issues that are important for a sustainable development of SSF and their viability (Béné et al. 2001). Through the viability kernel analysis, social, economic and biological constraints can be selected to illustrate possible recovery paths of a fishery (Martinet et al. 2007). The viability approach has also been implemented in regard to food security and ecological constraints of a fishery using an example from SSF in the Solomon Islands(Hardy et al. 2013). This is the first study known to the authors that brings in a wider context of development in relation to food security, poverty and their link to resource conservation using viability theory (Hardy et al. 2013). Other authors focus primarily on multi-objective problems in respect to natural resource management and conservation (Baumgärtner and Quaas, 2009; Péreau et al., 2012). Hardy et al. (2013) chose indicators from ecological (species richness) and economic (cash vs subsistence indices) to model the trade-offs between food security and biodiversity conservation. Different scenarios were modeled which show the different outcomes depending on the different economic, social and ecological variables that were used. Results from this contribution demonstrates that the status quo scenario is not favorable as it will not secure enough food for the local population and the biodiversity of the fished area will continue to decline. This study's conclusions suggest that the results from the model based on viability theory can serve as a baseline for finding a solution to the problems identified. These include the proposal of management strategies that combine biodiversity preservation and still fulfill the social and economic needs of the local community from the system. Additionally, Cissé et al. (2015) used the same approach as a function of eco-viability, which includes constraints such as food security, ecological indices (e.g., species richness) as well as profit viability to model different fishing scenarios as a basis to provide monitoring and management strategy recommendations using an example from French Guinean small-scale fisheries. The studies reviewed herein present some evidence of the effectiveness of using the viability theory approach to understand the complex dynamics of small-scale fisheries.It is also important to point out the limitation of models based on viability theory, for example, Martinet et al. (2007) discuss how economic constraints are seen as more stringent in their analyses whereas social aspects are less so. Furthermore, approaches to assess the viability of a fishery based on viability kernel analysis are primarily focused on their economic and ecological aspects, whereas social aspects are often underrepresented (Adeogun et al., 2009; Eisenack et al., 2006; Kronen et al., 2010; Martinet and Blanchard, 2009).  A few exceptions from the more recent studies presented above do incorporate food security, as a representation of the social dimension, into the viability theory approach. Their results demonstrate the importance of the integration of more than mere ecological and economic aspects into these fisheries assessments as management recommendations differ much depending on which constraints were applied (Hardy et al 2013 and Cisse et al 2015). However, it is critical to note that these are still only a few exceptions and that the management of renewable resources, ecosystems and biodiversity is still far from satisfying social, ecological and economic criteria (Doyen et al. 2013). Furthermore, the fact that only few constraints have been chosen to represent the social aspects of SSF can easily lead to an underrepresentation in this dimension.Additional to social drivers, it has also been shown that the institutional structure plays a key role not only in general for any system connected to the use of renewable resources (Ostrom, 1990) but specifically to SSF (Barclay and Cartwright, 2007; Trimble and Johnson, 2013). Trimble and Johnson (2013) argue that for a fishery to be economically viable, governance needs to be integrated into the dynamics of the fishery and therefore adaptable to changes within the fishing community and the fishery itself. Barclay and Cartwright (2007) present an example of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean and discuss how governments can improve the fishery's situation by having the right mindset and minimizing corruption. The governments can, therefore, have a positive influence on the fishing community and give incentives to be economically more efficient, despite little funding opportunities. Furthermore, it has been argued often that decentralized management through co-management is important (Sumaila and Domínguez-Torreiro, 2010), which has to be supported by participatory research that promotes integrated and participatory decision making processes (Jentoft et al., 1998; Lane and Stephenson, 1995). This is especially the case for improving SSF management where fishers are often isolated from and therefore frustrated with fisheries governance processes (Trimble and Berkes, 2013). Discussion and recommendationsThis review shows that for a fishery to be considered viable many criteria, variables and constraints need to be identified ideally from social, ecological, governance and economic dimensions at the same time. Small-scale fisheries are very dynamic and complex systems which makes assessing their economic viability extremely challenging especially when considering social factors, which are not easily captured using quantitative assessment methods. Various examples call for the inclusion of socio-economic and cultural factors into the assessment of a fishery's economic viability (Adeogun et al., 2009; Baumgärtner and Quaas, 2009; Lery et al., 1999).  This, however, is based merely on suggestions as no study on economic viability was found where social or socio-economic aspects were represented comprehensively. Moreover, currently in the literature, financial viability, economic performance and ecological-economic viability are used interchangeably to depict economic viability even though these terms have different meanings.Tisdell (1996) discusses how social cost benefit analysis is a good approach to incorporating externalities, ensuring that not only the private owner benefits from the system but the society as well. Furthermore, this article highlights that profit is necessary for a system to be viable; however, it is not the sole criteria. Tisdell (1996) argues that when dealing with natural resources, a holistic approach is needed as economic attributes depend not solely on financial factors. However, no solution has been presented on how safe minimum standards can be best determined while considering monetary and non-monetary values (Tisdell, 1996).The viability kernel analysis is already an extensive way of modeling the constraints and dynamics of a fishery addressing, inter alia, management, restoration, crisis situations and trade-offs. However, a few gaps in this analysis still need to be considered, especially when planning on using the approach specifically to SSF, which highly depend on social and governance aspects additionally to the financial and ecological ones. The rising complexity, the missing details, paucity of data availability and the underlying uncertainties (especially when incorporating social aspects) make it extremely challenging to adequately capture the more qualitative information about the fishery, suggesting that there is still room for improvement.For example, only few studies using the viability kernel analysis incorporate any sort of cultural and institutional aspects into their approach, which are key factors in SSF as pointed out in Section 2.1. Furthermore, despite the acknowledgement of the need to include more dimensions in the analysis of economic viability, this review demonstrates that it is still profit that is considered the main factor driving the fishery (e.g., Martinet et al., 2007). Therefore, existing approaches used to assess economic viability should be extended or reconsidered. Cissé et al. (2015) and Hardy et al., (2013) are useful examples where the challenge has been tackled and more social aspects have been integrated in relation to the livelihoods of small-scale fisheries communities and their economic viability. However, despite this step in the right direction and the success in capturing a larger part of the diverse dynamics of the SSF system, there is still more to explore and expand upon. Using food security, cash or subsistence economy and biodiversity conservation as set constraints is definitely insightful and important to the SSF system, however, other aspects such as subsidies, fair distribution of benefits or access to economic services might be equally important drivers of the fishery's economic viability. As explained by Berkes et al. (2001), the postharvest sector (including buyers, processors, and market linkages) is part of the fishery system, as well as its governance system. Hence, a fishery consists of biological, technological, economic, social, cultural, and political dimensions. Berkes et al. (2001) directed this statement more towards a functioning SSF management system; however, I find that similar reasoning applies when assessing the viability of SSF. Various approaches have been developed, suggested and discussed in the literature to achieve sustainable management of SSF and find ways to secure livelihoods in small-scale fishing communities (e.g., Allison and Ellis, 2001; Cunningham et al., 2009; Béné et al., 2010a).  Such frameworks include the wealth-based approach, which argues that poverty can be alleviated by introducing access rights to open access fisheries, which gives the natural resource the chance to recover and foster future rent maximization for the remaining fishers (Cunningham et al., 2009). Another example is the sustainable livelihood approach, which incorporates more dimensions such as vulnerability and marginalization (Allison and Ellis, 2001). It focuses more on the people and on poverty alleviation as well as promotes cross-sectorial thinking, rather than using economic rent as the main goal for the fishery (Allison and Horemans, 2006). The welfare function, another approach, explains how SSF absorb unskilled surplus labor and creates a safety-net for poor households, instead of functioning as a poverty trap (Béné et al., 2010a). All three approaches have their benefits and caveats, for example, the welfare approach has been found to lead to the unfair distribution of benefits within SSF fishing communities (e.g., Isaacs et al., 2007; Sinan and Whitmarsh, 2010). Furthermore, it is essential to understand the situation of a fishery before deciding whether (or which) of the existing approaches is adequate and realistic (Chuenpagdee and Jentoft, 2007). Hence, it could be useful to assess the economic viability of a SSF fishery to then identify the approach that is most in line with its needs to achieve sustainability, rectify marginalization and reduce its vulnerability to large scale threats. As poverty, vulnerability and marginalization are also mentioned as key aspects to be considered when planning to assess the economic viability of SSF (Béné and Friend, 2011; Allison and Horemans, 2006), it could also be useful to build upon what has already been created through existing frameworks and methodologies in order to learn from their successes, failures and their usefulness in understanding the economic viability of SSF.This study reviewed the definitions and approaches in regard to SSF, concluding that the lack of coherence that currently surrounds the term 'economic viability' needs to be rectified. I therefore decided to define what economic viability should mean for an active small-scale fishery. This definition incorporates only some of the aspects discussed in this article which are: society versus the private sector, the time component, and that nonnegative net benefits from SSF are more important than profit maximization. With this in mind, the definition is as follows:  A small-scale fishery is considered economically viable when nonnegative net benefits to society from fishing are maintained. To address the shortcoming of better incorporating the social and/or governance values in economic viability analysis I suggest once the net benefits to society are assessed a list of attributes will need to be identified and their importance and contribution to the economic viability tested.  The unequal distribution of global fisheries subsidies undermines the economic viability of small-scale fisheriesFisheries subsidies and small-scale fisheriesThe objective of this study is to understand the role that subsidies play in marine small-scale fisheries (SSF) globally. Therefore, we ask and address the following research questions: 1. What is the proportion of global fisheries subsidies that reach small-scale compared to large-scale fisheries? 2. How much of these subsidies are categorized as beneficial and capacity-enhancing for each sector? And 3. What do the results from 1. and 2. mean for the economic viability of small-scale fishers? The amount provided globally through fisheries subsidies, estimated at 35 billion USD (in 2009), is between 30 and 40% of the total gross revenue from global marine fisheries (1–3). After the 2nd World War, fisheries subsidies were provided to fisheries, to help lower the cost of fishing and thus enable them to catch more fish. The higher the subsidies, the more fish was caught. Today, however, the situation has changed; with the global decrease of fish stocks, most subsidies provided by governments turn to stimulate exploitation of already over-depleted resources in many cases (4–6). Therefore, many subsidies are considered to be harmful or capacity-enhancing rather than beneficial and have been identified as one of the main contributors to the current global fisheries crisis (e.g., (7–11).  Fisheries subsidies are defined here as financial transfers, which can be direct or indirect, from public entities to the fishing sector (5,8,9). The support from governments to the fishing sector can take many forms, including those provided by parastatals, by direct capital infusion, financial assistance and preferential tax treatment, expenditures on market promotion, fisheries management and research, as well as negotiating access agreements for distant water fleets (12). Furthermore, the term subsidy is being used interchangeably with support programs, financial support, economic assistance, and government financial transfers, all of which are payments that governments provide to the fisheries sector. Many studies have researched subsidies and their different impacts on fisheries and societies around the world (e.g., (2,7–9,13,14). Notably, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has taken on the subject of fisheries subsidies and included them as one of the key issues within the Doha Trade Round of Negotiation (15–18). An agreement was made in 2005 to implement rules that would regulate subsidies leading to overcapacity and overfishing, with the supporting argument that they negatively impact global trade, development and the environment (19,20). Unfortunately, the negotiations seem to have lost their impetus since 2011 in the WTO Doha Rounds and until today no agreement has been reached (19).Discussion within the WTO Doha Rounds have also included the plight of small-scale fisheries and it has been argued that SSF, especially of developing countries, should receive special treatment when international laws regarding harmful fisheries subsidies are implemented (17,21–23). However, negotiations have been proven to be more prolonged and complicated than anticipated and, again, still no consensus has been reached and no special rules have been defined (16). One of the main reasons for this, it has been argued, is that small-scale fisheries, as for all other fisheries, need to reach sustainability and are not immune to the negative impacts caused by harmful fisheries subsidies (16). On the contrary, some have argued that SSF need subsidies to help them minimize the effects of poverty and enhance their food security (23).However, almost all current studies on fisheries subsidies focus on large-scale (industrial) fisheries while the impact of fisheries subsidies on small-scale fisheries (including subsistence and artisanal fisheries) is essentially unexplored (24). Despite being understudied, the importance of small-scale fisheries in economies worldwide cannot be ignored. According to the FAO (25), between 85-98% of the 3.2 million marine fishing vessels active in the world can be classified as small-scale. It has been estimated that SSF support up to 22 million fishers, who make up about 44% of all fishers in the primary production sector (26). Additionally, another 100 million people are involved in the post-harvest sector of SSF as reported in (27). A definition of SSF for the purpose of this study can be found in the supporting information.Small-scale fisheries, face many challenges, including: ineffective management and weak governance; poverty and undernourishment in fishing communities; pressure from industrialization and global changes such as market shifts and climate change (28–30). The under-representation of local stakeholders in decision making processes have, furthermore, contributed to the marginalization of SSF (31–34). Economic viability assessments have informed management and policy decision making and presented trade-offs necessary to balance food security needs with ecosystem conservation of SSF communities (35,36). Understanding the economic viability of these fisheries is essential in rectifying their marginalization and bolstering them against potential crisis (37,38). Here, we refer to the whole society or the public sector, such that economic viability is accomplished when net benefits of an active fishery to society are non-negative over time (38). The fact that subsidies are shouldered by taxpayers, demonstrates that they are an integral part of the private fisher's economic viability. A first step, therefore, is to assess the subsidies provided to the small-scale fishing sector on a global scale. With this knowledge we can produce recommendations to policy makers on how to address some of the challenges SSF face and improve their economic viability. MethodologyData collectionWe assessed each fisheries subsidy entry (for each country and subsidy subtype) from the global fisheries subsidies database reported in (2,5) to find out how much of each annual subsidy is provided to the small-scale (SSF) and to the large-scale fisheries (LSF) sector, respectively. Subsidies can be divided into various categories. Following (2,5,39), the categorization applied in this study is based on a given subsidy's possible impact on fish stocks over time, which may or may not result in investment in sustainable fish stocks. The main categories are (i) ‘beneficial’; (ii) ‘capacity-enhancing’; and (iii) ‘ambiguous’ subsidies (see supporting information for subsidy subtypes). Of 146 maritime countries that provide fisheries subsidies to their fishing sectors, we analyzed subsidies in 79 countries, which were selected based on data availability and the amount of subsidies they provide globally. In all, these countries provide 97% of the estimated $35 billion annual global fisheries subsidies. To obtain a truly global sample, we also made sure that countries from each continent are covered (Fig. 1).  Information about fisheries subsidies was obtained from the following sources: (a) Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (10,40–45); (b) Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (46); (c) European Commission; (d) Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) web resources under fisheries country profiles (http://www.fao.org/fishery/countryprofiles/search/en); (e) national fisheries department web links, financial and budgetary reports, and fishery reports and documents; (f) United Nations Environment Program reports (47–49); (g) Global Marine Protected Areas (MPA) costs database (50); (h) regional financial institution portfolios such as the African Development Bank; (i) the World Trade Organization (WTO) trade notifications (http://www.wto.org/); (j) NGO reports on marine issues, such as WWF (51); (k) European Fisheries Fund (52); and (l) online resources including news articles and gray literature.Countries were grouped into developing and developed nations based on each country's Human Development Index (HDI) following (5). How the subsidies are split into SSF and LSF for each country and subsidy subtype is described in the following section.Non-fuel fisheries subsidiesFor each type of subsidy the collected information that was found in the literature was grouped into three categories as illustrated in Fig. 2. Group 1) Quantitative data; Group 2) Qualitative data (often reported in the form of bullet points and tables broken down into objectives), if a subsidy amount was described by more than one objective/bullet point, we split the total subsidy equally between the stated objectives; And Group 3) No data: Catch data used as a proxy is obtained from the Sea Around Us (www.seaaroundus.org last accessed on February 2016). We decided to use catch estimates from the Sea Around Us instead of FAO catch statistics because they include more information specifically on SSF catches (53–55). The Sea Around Us catch information distinguishes between the catch that has been caught in a country's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the amount caught by a country's fleet. Figure 2) Illustrating the methodology used to divide 2009 subsidy amounts into small- (SSF) and large-scale fisheries (LSF).To illustrate, as shown in Fig. 2, how the subsidy amount was split, we present an example of a description of the subtype “boat construction and renovation” from Thailand, see Fig. 3.Figure 3) Diagram shows how each fishery subsidy category is split into small- and large-scale based on available information, illustrated using an example from Thailand.Fuel subsidiesFuel subsidies are split into small- and large-scale depending on fuel consumption data availability using the method described in  (56). The amount of fuel consumed by a vessel depends on many factors, both operational and technological (57,58). Small-scale fisheries commonly use small, outboard engines powered by gasoline or use no engine, whereas industrial fishers tend to operate from large inboard engines powered by marine diesel (59). The Specific Fuel Consumption Rate (SFR) used for the small-scale sectors (artisanal and subsistence) was estimated to be 0.35kg/kWh and the equivalent number for the industrial sector is 0.2kg/kWh. These SFR represent the fuel consumption of engines in the mid 2000s, but engine efficiency has changed substantially over time. In order to account for this change, a fuel coefficient (FC) was estimated using fuel consumption data from Yanmar engines, an international builder and supplier of marine engines to adjust to the year 2009 (http://www.yanmarmarine.eu/ and (56)). The number of hours fished (can be interpreted as the number of hours the engine is running) was determined by sector: LSF are assumed to run their engines 24 hours a day when fishing (60) while SSF are assumed to fish 12 hours per day. See Fig 2 for the calculation of fuel consumption.Scaling up to global coverageTo divide the subsidies into those received by SSF and LSF for the remaining countries that were not assessed individually, and which represent 3% of the global subsidy amount, we divided the world into 21 subregions (based on the UN geoscheme), for each the SSF subsidy fraction per subsidy subtype was calculated (equation 1). Furthermore, we used the SSF fraction of the total catch per subregion and per country from the Sea Around Us database (see section 2.2.) to adjust the subsidies per subregion to each country (equation 2 and 3). This was carried out by calculating an adjustment factor (equation 4) for each country, which was then multiplied with the SSF subsidy per subregion and subsidy subtype (equation 5).The following mathematical equations are used in this calculations:SSF?subsidy?_(S,j)=∑_(S,j)^n?((SSF?subsidies?_(i,j))/(Total?subsidies?_(i,j) )) Equation 1SSF?catch?_i=(SSF?catch?_i)/(Total?catch?_i )Equation 2SSF?catch?_S=∑_i^n?((SSFcatch)_i/(Totalcatch)_i ) Equation 3Adjustment?factor?_i=(SSF?catch?_i)/(SSF?catch?_S )Equation 4SSFsubsidy?estimate?_i=SSF?subsidy?_(S,j)?Adjustment?factor?_iEquation 5with n being the number of recorded data entries of each assessed country i, subregion S and subsidy subtype j. The SSF subsidy estimate for each country per subtype is multiplied with the total amount of subsidy per subtype for the relevant country to obtain the SSF subsidy amount in USD (2009).ResultsSmall-scale versus large-scale fisheries subsidiesIt is estimated that global fisheries received 35 billion USD in total in 2009  (2). Our estimates show that 5.6 billion 2009 USD of these are provided to the small-scale fishing sector. This is only 15.8% of total fisheries subsidies provided by governments worldwide (Fig 3).Figure 4) Global fisheries subsidies divided into large- and small-scale fisheries and split into three subsidy categories: Beneficial, capacity-enhancing and ambiguous.A first rough estimate reported in (61) shows that global fisheries subsidies are divided into 5-7 and 25-27 billions USD for small- and large-scale fisheries, respectively.  The fact that these two approaches yielded similar results provides confidence in the estimates.The composition of the subsidy estimates by sector and subsidy category, demonstrated in Fig. 3, shows that small-scale fisheries received 2.7, 2.3 and 0.6 billion USD of beneficial, capacity-enhancing and ambiguous subsidies, respectively. Subsidies to LSF, on the other hand, are divided into 8.4, 17.8 and 3.6 billion USD, respectively, for the same categories. Results show that 89% of the estimated 20 billion USD capacity-enhancing subsidies go to the large-scale fishing sector. Fuel subsidies are the highest subsidy amount provided to the total fishing sector globally (2), out of which, we find that the SSF sector receives only 6% (equivalent to 0.5 billion USD). Our study suggests that the highest amount in total provided to the SSF sector are subsidies for fisheries management and monitoring (beneficial subsidies) with 1.8 billion USD (representing 25.7% of the total amount provided to SSF), Table 1. The subsidy subtypes for which the SSF receive the lowest percentage are 'fishing access' and 'vessel buyback' (0 and 0.2%, respectively), Table 1. See supporting information for a detailed breakdown of the data by country and subsidy subtype.Table 2) Global fisheries subsidies by category and subtype for small- and large-scale fisheries.Subsidy subtype / USD in million (2009)Small-scaleLarge-scaleTotalBeneficialFisheries management and monitoring1,8355,3037,137Fisheries research and development5882,1202,708Marine Protected Areas2719581,229Capacity-enhancingFuel subsidies4627,1087,570Fishing port development7222,7383,460Boat construction and renovation5032,7963,299Market and storage infrastructure1862,5182,704Tax exemption1479481,095Fisheries development projects2707751,045Fishing access0937937AmbiguousVessel buyback programs32,0762,080Fisher assistance4801,4631,942Rural fisher communities13826164Fisheries subsidies by level of developmentA first rough estimate reported in (61) shows that global fisheries subsidies are divided into 5-7 and 25-27 billions USD for small- and large-scale fisheries, respectively.

Our study suggests that the highest amount in total provided to the SSF sector are subsidies for fisheries management and monitoring (beneficial subsidies) with 1.8 billion USD (representing 25.7% of the total amount provided to SSF), Table 1.

See supporting information for a detailed breakdown of the data by country and subsidy subtype.Figure 5) Global fisheries subsidies by developed and developing countries by fisheries subsidy category (capacity-enhancing, beneficial and ambiguous) for small- and large-scale fisheries.Table 2 shows that the regions which provide the lowest amount of subsidies in total are the regions giving more to the SSF sector. For example, Africa provides 33% of their total subsidies, which accounts for only 2.5% of global fisheries subsidies, to SSF. Asia as the leading subsidizing region, represents 53% of total SSF subsidies, and it provides only 19% to its SSF. Europe and Oceania provide the lowest percentages to the SSF (7% and 4%, respectively), whereas their total subsidies combined make up for 33% of all subsidies. While the difference between the highest and lowest subsidizing regions is quite large (Asia and Africa respectively, see Table 2), the size of the fishing sector (SSF and LSF) per region also differs. We therefore calculated the ratio of subsidy estimates to number of fishers per regions for SSF and LSF to normalize for the differences in sector size per region and as a measure of subsidy intensity. Data of direct employment in marine fisheries was taken from (26). Table 3) Subsidies in million USD and subsidy intensity (subsidy amount / number of fishers), information on direct employment (# of fishers) taken from (Teh and Sumaila, 2013) by region.RegionSSF subsidies (USD x 106)LSF subsidies (USD x 106)SSF subsidies (percent)SSF subsidy intensity (USD per fisher)LSF subsidy intensity (USD per fisher)Ratio SSF/LSF intensityAfrica291600331297175.5Asia3,02312,490191944182.5Oceania1413,178421268,988*325SC America5261,164311881,0585.6Europe6007,97173,68212,6543.4N America1,0234,362192,27912,2195.4Total5,60529,767162561,0284.0*The value for Oceania is an outlier probably due to an underestimation of large-scale fishers active in that region due to large pelagic oversea fisheries.In total, with respect to global subsidies, we estimate that LSF receive 4 times more subsidies per fisher than SSF.  That is, while a typical small-scale fisher receives around USD 250, a large-scale fisher receives support about USD 1,000 per year. Looking into regional data, the calculation shows that Asia has the lowest discrepancy between sectors followed by Europe, providing 2.5 and 3.4 times more subsidies per fisher employed in LSF compared to one active in a small-scale fishery, respectively. DiscussionCapacity-enhancing fisheries subsidies mainly benefit the large-scale fisheries sector and undermine the economic viability of SSF.Our results show that the distribution of fisheries subsidies creates a huge bias against the SSF sector, which is already threatened by large industrial fisheries especially in developing countries (62). This bias clearly undermines the economic viability of SSF by making LSF artificially more competitive in the market place than their SSF counterparts.The biggest subsidy subtype is fuel subsidies, which is provided to 96% to the large-scale sector (Table 1), i.e., marine diesel, whereas most SSF vessels run on gasoline due to the high cost of purchasing and maintaining diesel motors (58). Fuel subsidies are recognized for their negative impacts both on the fisheries economy and marine ecosystems (13,63). They foster the use of fuel-inefficient technology and help the LSF stay in business even though operating costs outweigh total revenue gained from fishing (6,13). Subsidies towards port development and boat construction, renewal and modernization, of which the SSF receives only a small fraction, give the LSF sector another significant advantage over their small-scale counterparts.Furthermore, subsidies that pay for foreign access agreements aggravate the harm that subsidies can do, especially to underdeveloped SSF in developing countries (62). A framework and recommendations on how to address some of these disadvantages have been proposed. For example, in (64), it is recommended that the European Commission Fisheries Fund assistance should not be used to cover the cost of fishing access agreements. Instead, these funds, which are paid for mainly by European tax payers, should focus on improving the host countries' monitoring and enforcement capacities to foster sustainable fishing practices. This would not only benefit the local fisheries, which are mainly small-scale, but also bring higher economic rent to the foreign fleets in the long term. Only a small fraction, 0.2% of vessel buybacks, which has been shown to often affect fisheries sustainability negatively (7), reaches SSF (Fig. 2). An example, reported in (37), shows that making storage facilities available to SSF can vastly improve their fisheries economic viability, because it increases their adaptive capacity and makes them resilient in times of crisis. Subsidies for market and storage are to 97% provided to LSF, exacerbating the struggle of SSF reaching economic viability.The need to take action to reduce capacity-enhancing fisheries subsidiesResults from this study clearly show that the vast majority of subsidies, especially in developing countries, is provided as capacity-enhancing subsidies to large-scale fisheries. These do not help poor coastal communities, but instead provide a direct advantage to the already overpowering LSF sector, leaving the SSF sector with hardly any chance of achieving economic viability. Clearly, food security and the maintenance of livelihoods should be in the foreground when negotiating fisheries subsidies (e.g., (27,36,67–69). Fortunately, international NGOs (e.g. Oceana, WWF) and the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD) are playing crucial roles and continue to publish and advocate towards prohibiting capacity-enhancing fisheries subsidies, which negatively impact global fisheries sustainability. Furthermore, an important and exciting agreement has been reached in the fourteenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Nairobi, Kenya, in July 2016 towards ending harmful subsidies. The mandate is that the regulation of fisheries subsidies becomes an integral part of the implementation of the 2030 sustainable development agenda. This joint statement brought forward by UNCTAD, FAO and UNEP (United Nation Environment Programme) has been currently signed by 90 countries and 11 international, regional and civil society organizations. It has reintroduced most of the discussions that were held at the WTO Doha rounds and includes: 1. to improve transparency in what subsidies countries provide; 2. prohibit harmful fisheries subsidies, not only those to overfishing and illegal fishing but also those that jeopardize nutritional security and livelihoods of coastal community; 3. introduce instruments and tools to discourage from new harmful subsidies and 4. give special attention and treatment for developing countries, focusing on least developed and Small Islands Development States, (65).Caveats and suggestions to improve data quality for effective decision makingCurrently, the most comprehensive database for small- and large-scale marine fisheries is provided by the Sea Around Us, without which this study would have not been possible. However, using catch data as a proxy for the size of the fishing sector comes with its own caveats. For example, either sector could be much smaller or bigger depending on fish abundance and target species. This highlights the need for a detailed database of global fishing effort disaggregated by sector and collected independently from catch information. One of the main issues that has been reported in the past when studying fisheries subsidies (2,5,24,66), and which we experienced in this study also, is the scarcity of data and lack of transparency. Due to international pressure from different NGOs and international organizations, the European Commission, has now made information on fisheries subsidies (or fisheries funds) of their member states much more transparent and the amounts are provided online (52). Yet, categories are still very broad, no information is published on who exactly receives these funds, nor is it clear how much each individual country provides in addition. Also, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) are making efforts to increase transparency by frequently publishing reports on the amounts of fisheries subsidies provided by their members (10). These efforts are steps in the right direction, however, much more transparency is still needed to carry out more in depth research to advance effective decision making for sustainable fisheries management.  Fortunately, the now signed UNCTAD-FAO-UNEP agreement, clearly calls for more detailed information on fisheries subsidies and has addressed the persistent lack of information surrounding this topic (65). Attention needs to be paid not only to which category fisheries subsidies fall into, but also which fishing sector benefits, in order to understand all underlying dynamics of the impacts fisheries subsidies have on natural marine resources and the people who depend on them.  ConclusionsAs subsides are completely paid for by taxpayers, results of this study should be of great concern to our global working population. Currently, their money is not only being used to further the degradation of our ocean's ecosystems, but also to increase the gap between the big industrialized (large-scale) fisheries and small-scale fisheries that support millions of livelihoods and food security worldwide often in impoverished and threatened coastal communities.  The economic and political marginalization that SSF face can only be tackled when data, such as information on subsidies, is available and assessments (e.g., analyzing impacts of subsidies on sustainable fisheries) can be carried out integrating all dimensions: social, economic, ecosystem and institutional. This study's contribution will improve the chance to effectively address the concerns regarding subsidies provided to SSF and help the urgently needed recovery of our oceans. As our results indicate, there is no argument left that can be made against reducing and converting capacity-enhancing subsidies into beneficial ones. In conclusion, our recommendation is not to increase subsidies to small-scale fisheries but instead to reduce those proven to be harmful to resource conservation and economic viability of fisheries in general. Supporting informationDefining small-scale fisheries and subsidy subtype descriptionSmall- and large-scale fisheries subsidies data by country and subsidy subtypeDetermining basic economic viability of small- compared to large-scale fisheries using Mexico as an example1. IntroductionEconomic viability, which not only encompasses the financial performance of fisheries, is an important cornerstone when it comes to developing management and policies towards sustainable fisheries (Eisenack et al., 2006; Baumgärtner and Quaas, 2009; Cissé et al., 2015; Schuhbauer and Sumaila, 2016). This is especially true for small-scale fisheries, which are often part of local culture and traditions and have been found to not only focus on profitability (Kronen, 2004; Hospital and Beavers, 2012). Following Schubauer and Sumaila (2016), an active fishery is considered to be economically viable when its net benefit contribution to society from fishing is positive over time. Economic attributes such as total revenue, total costs and fisheries subsidies, components of net benefits are, therefore, important for calculating a fishery's economic viability. Small-scale fisheries are known to be politically and economically marginalized worldwide (Pauly, 1997; Allison and Ellis, 2001; Chuenpagdee, 2011), despite the fact that they make up for about 44% of all fishers in the primary production sector and provide livelihoods for millions of people (Béné et al., 2010; Teh and Sumaila, 2013). Additionally, these coastal community-based fisheries are understudied and found to be threatened by global market shifts, climate change and large-scale fisheries (Kaczynski and Fluharty, 2002; Béné et al., 2010; Lam et al., 2012; Sumaila et al., 2014). Large-scale (industrial) fisheries (LSF) are not only more technologically advanced than small-scale fisheries, but are often given advantages on economic and political levels. For example, LSF are estimated to receive 84% of global fisheries subsidies, national management strategies and policies are often geared towards LSF and overlook SSF, plus most fisheries research, globally, focuses on LSF (Pauly, 1997; Chuenpagdee and Bundy, 2006; Chuenpagdee et al., 2006; Zeller et al., 2006; Jacquet and Pauly, 2008; Chuenpagdee, 2011 and Chapter 3 of this thesis). This chapter aims to understand, assess and compare economic viability of small- and large-scale fisheries and addresses the following research questions for the small- and large-scale sector separately: 1. How much is the total revenue from fishing? 2. What are the total economic costs of fishing? 3. How much subsidies are provided to both fishing sectors? 4. What are the net benefits to society (that is, economic viability) generated by small- and large-scale fisheries?  and 5. What implications do these results have for policy and management of the assessed fisheries?In recent years efforts have been made by researchers and international organizations to more thoroughly collect information on fisheries subsidies, the catch and revenues they generate and the fishing costs they incur (OECD, 2006a; Lam et al., 2011; Swartz et al., 2013; FAO, 2014; Pauly and Zeller, 2016; Sumaila et al., 2016). However, most of these key economic aspects lack detail and are still not well documented at national levels. Information on catch, landed value and subsidies has been disaggregated by fishing sector (SSF and LSF), showing on the one hand how important the small-scale sector is globally (based on amounts of landings and total revenue) and at the same time disadvantaged due to unfair subsidy distribution (Pauly and Zeller, 2016) and Chapter 3). The more we understand these aspects the better can the behavior of fishers and the fleet be evaluated to identify trends in fishing effort and distribution necessary for sustainable management considering social, economic and ecosystem dimensions (Lam et al., 2011).Here, I choose Mexico as an example as it is a well-studied developing country in terms of fisheries, however, most studies focus on the larger (industrial) fisheries, such as those for sardine, tuna and shrimp as well as on ecological aspects (e.g., Garcia-Caudillo et al., 2000; Lluch-Cota et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2009; Ishimura et al., 2013; Punt et al., 2016). Although Mexico's marine small-scale fishing fleet is, among the largest small-scale fisheries globally (based on catch and employment), it is understudied and largely unregulated (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013; Teh and Sumaila, 2013). This sector is comprised of around 70,000 small fiberglass boats, catching around 900 thousand tonnes of fish and invertebrates per year (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013). Some regional and local studies as well as efforts by national government institutions have revealed the social, economic, political and ecological importance of small-scale fisheries in Mexico (e.g., Smith et al., 2009; Cisneros-Mata, 2010; Espinoza-Tenorio et al., 2011b; Salas et al., 2011; Conapesca, 2013). This sector is embedded in a wide cultural context providing food and employment for hundreds of thousands of people and contributing to coastal social and economic development (OECD, 2006b; Lluch-Cota et al., 2007). Small-scale fisheries are complex and diverse as target species and fishing methods vary for different seasons and regions and landing sites are spread along the coastlines (Smith et al., 2009; Finkbeiner, 2015). This complexity makes monitoring and sustainable management of these fisheries challenging (Sala et al., 2004; Cudney-Bueno and Basurto, 2009; Erisman et al., 2011; Salas et al., 2011).The lack of communication between the central government and people involved in small-scale coastal fishing in Mexico has led to mismanagement in many places leading to marine ecosystem degradation (Young, 2001; Sala et al., 2004; Lluch-Cota et al., 2007; Cudney-Bueno and Basurto, 2009; Espinoza-Tenorio et al., 2011a). Additionally, Mexican small-scale fisheries suffer from extreme climate fluctuations caused by phenomena such El Nino and are very vulnerable to climate change (Collins et al., 2002; Pérez-Brunius et al., 2006; Morzaria-Luna et al., 2014; Sumaila et al., 2014; Páez-Osuna et al., 2016). Furthermore, that large-scale fisheries receive mostly capacity-enhancing fisheries subsidies is alarming as many small-scale fisheries already suffer from overfishing and overcapacity (Pauly, 1997, 2006; Jackson et al., 2001; Sala et al., 2004; Zeller and Pauly, 2005; Salas et al., 2007; Barnes-Mauthe et al., 2013; Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2016). Strategies on how to better use fisheries subsidies (taxpayer's money), for both the large- and small-scale sectors have already been suggested and should be taken into account by policy makers worldwide (Sumaila et al., 2010, 2016; Charles, 2011; Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2016 and chapter 3). For example, effective subsidies should address the core issues a fishery industry is facing and not just the symptoms by increasing profits, furthermore, policy makers should focus on establishing clear feasible long term goals (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2016). Another example is to bring education and skill development to coastal communities to increase employment opportunities to coastal fishers (Sumaila et al., 2016). This is especially important in a developing country such as Mexico, where coastal small-scale fisheries are essential for the well-being of hundreds of thousands of people and over 20 million people suffer from undernourishment (Olaiz-Fernandez et al., 2006). These suggestions directed at fisheries subsidies in general, will bring more equity to the distribution of subsidies and, I argue, with it improve economic viability.Fisheries specific studies and government reports are the sources of information used to compute revenues, fishing costs and subsidies of Mexican fisheries and form an important cornerstone for economic viability assessments (OECD, 2006c; Conapesca, 2013; Ramírez-Rodríguez and Almendárez-Hernández, 2013; Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2016). However, not much is known on these main economic indicators (costs, revenues and subsidies) and their impact on small- compared to large-scale fisheries over time. Here, these will be provided and analyzed from 2000-2012 on a national as well as regional level. The situation of Mexican fisheries is not an exception but rather a typical example of small-scale fisheries globally. Therefore, results and conclusions drawn from this chapter will be a helpful guideline to fill knowledge gaps to support policy making essential to the optimization of sustainable fisheries management in general. 2. Methods2.1 Case study: Mexican fisheriesBased on the definition of the Mexican National Commission of Aquaculture and Fishing, the marine small-scale fishing sector includes artisanal commercial fisheries by both indigenous and non-indigenous fishers, who sell most of their catch and often keep a portion of it for household consumption. All fishers use “pangas”, open-deck, fiberglass boats around 7 m in length, usually with 50-115 hp outboard engines. The most common fishing gears used are gillnets, hook-and-line, hookas (a regulator and on-board air-compressor), traps, and a range of small bottom-trawl nets. Large-scale (or industrial) fisheries, on the other hand, include vessels with a covered deck, inboard engine (almost exclusively diesel), mechanical winches and their fishing gear including otter trawls, purse-seiners and longlines. There is an offshore fleet targeting tunas and billfishes, and a large coastal fleet targeting shrimp and small pelagic fishes (e.g., sardines). Although recreational fisheries in Mexico are a significant industry for some regional economies and interact strongly with marine ecosystems and other fisheries (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2012), they are not included in the assessment carried out in this study.Fisheries on the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts of Mexico can be quite different to each other. Especially in regard to the large-scale sector, which mainly depends on shrimp, sardine and tuna on the Pacific coast, whereas most boats on the Atlantic target finfish and shrimp (OECD, 2006b; Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013; Conapesca, 2013). Therefore, the following assessment will be carried out on a national and regional (Pacific and Atlantic) scale. Table X) Key attributes to compute basic economic viability of a fishery, geographical scale (global, national, regional) and time frame depend on the study's application.Nº Economic Attributes  (unit)DefinitionSources and measures1Landings (t)Amount of fish in weight landed in all ports (2000-2012).For national numbers see FAO and SAUP1 (Sea Around Us Project, specifically catch reconstruction data) database.For case studies check literature, e.g., government reports; conduct surveys; and monitor the landing.2Ex-vessel price ($)Price received by fishers at the dock per unit weight of fish sold (Sumaila et al., 2007).For national numbers see Fisheries Economic Research Unit (FERU) and SAUP database (Sumaila et al., 2007 and Swartz et al., 2013)1For case studies check literature e.g., government reports, conduct surveys, log book, buyer record.3Total Cost of fishing ($)Total cost represents the value of inputs at the next alternative best use. Cost is split up into fixed cost, which do not change with production (e.g., capital investment, sunk cost) and variable cost, which can vary based on the output (e.g., fuel, crew, maintenance). The total cost includes opportunity cost which makes it different from accounting cost. (Lam et al., 2011).For national numbers see FERU database 1 (Lam et al., 2011).For case studies check literature, e.g., government reports and/or conduct surveys.4Subsidies ($)Subsidies are defined here as financial transfers, direct or indirect, from public entities to the fishing sector which help the sector make more profit than it would otherwise (Sumaila et al., 2010). For national numbers see Sumaila et al. (2010)For case studies check literature, e.g., government reports and conduct surveys and interview key informants.
2.2 Total revenueTotal Revenue (TR) is calculated as follows:TR=PxTLEquation 6Where P denotes non-distorted ex-vessel prices and TL the total fisheries landings. TR is calculated for each year t of the study period 2000-2012 as the sum of all units:?TR?_t=∑_(i=1)^(unit x)??(TRt_t)?_i Equation 7Where unit represents a fishing vessel or a fishing company that owns more than one vessel and unit x the total number of units for each year t. Sources for the calculations for ex-vessel prices are from the Sea Around Us and Fisheries Economic Research Unit databases (www.seaaroundus.org) and from the National  Commission of Aquaculture and Fishing annual fisheries reports (CONAPESCA) (Conapesca, 2013; Swartz et al., 2013) http://www.conapesca.sagarpa.gob.mx/wb/). Landings data for the years 2000 to 2010 from Sea Around Us (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013) were already disaggregated into large-scale (industrial) and small-scale (artisanal and subsistence) fisheries and therefore directly multiplied with ex-vessel prices to estimate total revenue. For 2011 -2012, data from CONAPESCA reports were used, which contained total revenue data. These were divided into small- and large-scale based on each sector's fisheries landings (percentages) per species group using 2010 Sea Around Us data. To make up for missing information on unreported and illegal catches for the years 2011-2012, I used 2010 total revenue data from unreported and illegal landings from (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013) and added them to the 2011 and 2012 CONAPESCA data which only represent the total revenue of reported fisheries landings in Mexico. 2.3 Total costs from fishingTotal Costs (TC) are calculated as followsTC=VC+FCEquation 8Where VC represent variable costs which comprise of fuel, maintenance, labour and other running costs (e.g., docking fees, administrative costs, licenses) and FC denotes fixed costs which consist of depreciation and interest paid on capital cost. It is important to note that total costs were assumed to be non-distorted which means estimated before subsidies (e.g., tax reductions) were added.TC is calculated for each year t of the study period 2000-2012 as the sum of all units:?TC?_t=∑_(i=1)^(unit x)?(?TC?_t )_i Equation 9Where unit represents a fishing vessel or a fishing company that owns more than one vessel and unit x the total count of all units for each year. To assess the cost of fishing for Mexican small- versus large-scale fisheries, I based my method on data from the cost structure of individual fishing units. Cost structure is the ratio of the different categories of variable and fixed costs to total costs. For the large-scale fishing sector, data were mainly available for the three biggest fisheries: shrimp, sardine and tuna, which make up about 65% of the total large-scale fisheries catch of Mexico (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013). I used information from (Gillet, 2008; Agroprospecta, 2010) for shrimp and sardine fisheries and (Lam et al., 2011) for tuna fisheries and computed a weighted average based on number of boats active in each fishery. For small-scale fisheries, I used information from (OECD, 2006b; Lam et al., 2011; Ramírez-Rodríguez and Almendárez-Hernández, 2013). As I found that the cost of fuel was the largest component (around 35% on average), I used the change of fuel costs over time to estimate the total costs for each year of the study period (2000-2012). This assumes that other costs of fishing stayed constant over time. The cost of fuel was estimated for both SSF and LSF using annual fuel consumption data based on fishing effort. The amount of fuel consumed by each vessel depends on operational and technological factors, I therefore used: specific fuel consumption rate (SFR), Fuel Coefficient (FC) and the number of hours fished (Wilson, 1999; Gulbrandsen, 2012; Greer, 2014).To scale up the data to the fishing fleet for SSF and LSF for each year, I used numbers of boats active from CONAPESCA annual reports. Where data was not available, gaps were filled with existing data from similar Mexican fisheries of the same year or of a previous year. As data on cost of fishing is scarce especially for small-scale fisheries, it was important to use and compare different approaches and case-study data to make sure that the resulting numbers were realistic. This was done using raw data per fishing gear from different countries reported in (Lam et al., 2011) and information found in (OECD, 2006b; Tietze et al., 2001a, 2005). As information in government report is disaggregated either by coastline or by federate state, this data was used to assess total cost by Atlantic and Pacific region for both SSF and LSF applying the same method described above for the national level study. 2.4 SubsidiesFisheries subsidies are direct or indirect financial transfers from public entities (i.e., tax revenues) to private firms (here, the fishing sector) (Milazzo, 1998; OECD, 2006a; Sumaila et al., 2008). Subsidies are categorized, depending on their impact on the fish stocks over time, into beneficial, capacity-enhancing and ambiguous (Sumaila et al., 2010). Many different forms such as financial assistance, tax breaks, fisheries management and research as well as direct capital infusion are considered subsidies (e.g., (Abdallah and Sumaila, 2007). Data on fisheries subsidies were collected from different reports and publications and up-dated where possible using fisheries reports, CONAPESCA annual reports, peer-reviewed articles, OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) reports and gray literature  (OECD, 2006b; Lara and Guevara-Sangines, 2012; Ramírez-Rodríguez and Almendárez-Hernández, 2013; Sumaila et al., 2016). Based on the objective stated in the literature that described what each fishery subsidy was for, it was possible to divide them into percentages directed at large- and small-scale fisheries for the years 2000 to 2012. Furthermore, once gathered information of total subsidies for each year (2000 – 2012) data from CONAPESCA annual reports were used to find percentages that would reach the small- compared to the large-scale sector, which were then applied to the total subsidy amount where no other detailed description was available (see chapter 3 for more detailed description of the methods). Again, based mainly on CONAPESCA reports the same approach was used to disaggregated the data by region.The amount of subsidies (TS) received from the government, is calculated for each year t of the study period 2000-2012 as the sum of all units:?TS?_t=∑_(i=1)^unitx?(?TS?_t )_i Equation 10where TS = Total Subsidies and unit represents a fishing vessel or a fishing company that owns more than one vessel.  Costs and prices are assumed to be otherwise non-distorted.
2.5 Economic viability calculationEconomic viability, defined here, are the net benefits to society from fishing, a fishery is considered economically viable once these are non-negative. On the other hand, a fishery would be financially viable when net benefits from fishing to the private sector are non-negative.To estimate the economic viability as Net Benefits (NB) from fishing, the following calculations are carried out for both small- and large-scale fisheries for the years t = 2000 to 2012. Equations 1-4 above are used to calculate net benefits to society as follows:?NB?_t^S=?TR?_t^S-?TC?_t^SEquation 11where the superscript, S, denotes society.Equation 7 below is used to calculate the average economic viability (net benefits to society: NBS) over the years under study here (n):¯(?NB?^S )=1/n?∑_(t=2000)^2012??NB?_t^S Equation 12Financial viability, as in net benefits to the private sector, on the other hand, are calculated as expressed in equation (8). The key difference between equation (6) and (8) is that the economic viability is distorted by subsidies (equation 5), ?NB?_t^p=?TR?_t^p-?TC?_t^p+?TS?_tEquation 13where the superscript, p, denotes the private sector.Average net benefits to the private sector:¯(?NB?^p )=1/n?∑_(t=2000)^2012?(?NB?_t^p ) Equation 14From the perspective of society, the amount of subsidy paid to fishers is a cost (equation 6). It should be noted that in formulating the equations above, we assume, that the only distortion is the subsidy received by the fishing unit. From the point of view of the private sector, on the other hand, subsidies are added, because each fishing unit benefits from the subsidy provided to it (equation 8). To verify the quality of all collected data, I sought out two fisheries scientists who are deeply knowledgeable about Mexican fisheries and compared their experiences and data with my results (personal communication with Dr. Miguel Angel Cisneros-Mata and Dr. Elena Finkbeiner). To make sure that our numbers are comparable over time and comparable to studies from other countries, I expressed values in constant 2015 USD using currency conversion rates from Mexican Peso to USD (Feenstra et al., 2015) and the Consumer Price Index taken from the World Bank website to convert amounts from real to constant USD (last accessed July 2016 http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL).3. Results and discussion 3.1. Total revenueAlthough small-scale fisheries have landed less than half of Mexican total fisheries landings (sum of landings 2000-2010) (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013), their total revenue on average (2000-2012) is over 30% higher than those of their large-scale counterpart (Table 1). The main reason for this is that a high percentage of large-scale fisheries landings (especially on the Pacific coast) is not for direct human consumption and therefore fetches lower prices (e.g., sardine fisheries) than most other fish and seafood (Conapesca, 2013). Estimated total revenue from fishing has decreased for large- and increased for small-scale fisheries over time (Fig. 1a). When looking into the regional difference of total revenue by fishing sector, trends of total revenue over time show a clear decline on the Atlantic, however, on the Pacific they have stayed more stable with a slight increase even. Looking into SSF, the trends are the opposite, with total revenue increasing on the Pacific and slightly decreasing on the Atlantic (Fig 1d). Target species vary not only between the two fishing sectors but also across the two regions. Total revenue trends can therefore be explained with both changes in prices and resource availability. For example, the decline of large-scale fisheries total revenue could be due to the drop in large-scale shrimp catches and landed value (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013), which makes up over 60% of the total landed value of large-scale fishing in both regions combined. For small-scale fisheries, on the other hand, both landings and landed values increased over time on the Pacific, despite the fact that the number of vessels in the sector decreased in the same period of time (Table 1 and Fig. 1). This indicates that prices for small-scale fisheries landings have stayed rather stable or increased, at least in the Pacific region.3.2. Total costs of fishing There are about 20 times more small- than large-scale fishing vessels active in Mexico, because of which the results show much higher total cost for small- compared to large-scale fisheries (Table 1). However, the annual cost for an individual large-scale fishing vessel on average is almost 10 times higher than the cost of a small-scale vessel (around USD 20,000 vs 200,000, respectively). The total costs estimated from 2000 to 2012 for the large-scale sector have increased by around 20%, whereas decreased by over 30% for the small-scale sector (Table 1 and Fig 1). Trends of the national total costs over time are very similar when broken down into regions for both SSF and LSF (Fig 1e). The number of fishing vessels in SSF has dropped by around 35% whereas only decreased by around 11% in LSF sector. This explains the decrease in total costs for SSF and increase for LSF.  Looking into the trends of costs per boat over time by sector and region, results indicate an increase in costs per boat for LSF both on the Atlantic and Pacific, whereas a decrease for SSF. The price of fuel and number of fishing vessels seem to be the important drivers in this assessment. Fuel makes up a large percentage of the total costs. Prices for diesel fuel have risen from 2000 to 2012 by almost 30%, which is reflected in the increase in the cost per vessel in the large-scale sector (Table 1). Gasoline prices, on the other hand, have stayed more stable, which has helped the cost of fishing per boat for SSF to stay more stable even without much subsidy support (Table 1).  Table 1) Number of boats, fuel prices and cost per vessel in constant 2015 USD million of Mexican small- (SSF) and large-scale (LSF) fisheries.Number vesselsUSD / litreCost USD / vesselYearSSFLSFGasolineDieselSSFLSF200099,8043,5660.780.6422,439190,356200199,8043,6180.760.6321,948187,640200299,8043,6270.780.6522,637195,037200399,8043,6340.710.5920,531178,407200499,8043,6420.680.5719,503169,815200599,8043,4940.710.5820,154175,827200699,8043,4330.710.5920,380177,650200799,8043,3980.720.6120,667185,401200899,8043,3980.720.6320,542190,811200999,8043,3000.630.6418,042194,962201087,3063,2060.710.7520,410228,027201175,3233,1810.790.8222,439250,540201264,4573,1580.810.8323,044256,965Average94,2403,4350.730.6620,980198,572Additionally, to the number of fishing vessels active in each sector the number of hours and days fished each year is a key factor in the cost calculation also. However, due to a lack of more detailed information these are assumed to have stayed constant over the years. This assumption, while it simplified our analysis, creates a bias as there is the probability that fishers have changed their behaviors within the 13 years of the study period and might be traveling further and fishing for more hours to help make up for changes or declines in near-shore availability of marine resources (Sagarin et al., 2008) and pers. communication with Dr. E. Finkbeiner). Additionally, the number of boats used in this study were based on government reports and for the small-scale sector had not changed from 2000 to 2009, neither on the Atlantic nor the Pacific region, which might be due to the lack of effective monitoring of the number of active boats. Nonetheless, I believe despite a possible underestimation of active boats due to lack of monitoring the bias is consistent throughout the years due to the same data source. Figure 1) Total revenue from fishing; total cost of fishing; fisheries subsidies on a national level and by regions (Pacific and Atlantic), (a,b,c and d,e,f, respectively).

Fisheries subsidiesCapacity-enhancing fisheries subsidies can compromise the sustainable use of fish stocks and distort prices and costs of fishing. As shown in chapter 3, the large-scale sector receives most capacity-enhancing fisheries subsidies, not only in Mexico but globally. Fig. 1c shows annual subsidies provided from 2000 – 2012 to Mexican fisheries divided into those provided to small- and large-scale fisheries. While the amount of subsidies provided to Mexican fisheries has increased, the percentage provided to the small-scale sector decreased from almost 40% in 2000 to only 12% in 2012 (Fig 1c). On average, from 2000 to 2012, this analysis suggests that large-scale fisheries have received over 70% of all fisheries subsidies (Table 1). The trend shows that SSF receive a decreasing share of total subsidies over the studied years while the amount of subsidies provided in total has been increasing (Fig 1c). While SSF employ more people and also take almost half of the total fisheries catches receiving such a little share of subsidies creates a bias in favour of lSF. The regional analysis reveals that the Atlantic receive much less subsidies than the Pacific for both SSF and LSF, however, both SSF and LSF sectors are smaller in regard to catch, number of people and number of boats compared to the Pacific. Furthermore, it becomes clear that Pacific LSF not only receive the largest share overall but the subsidies they receive have increased three fold over the 13 years study period (from USD 59 to 192 million). Trends of subsidies provided to Atlantic LSF and SSF as well as Pacific SSF all have been quite stable with neither much of an increase or decrease (Fig 1c and f).3.4. Basic economic viability Results from calculating net benefits over the 13 year study period show as expected lower net benefits to society (economic viability) compared to the net benefits to the private sector (financial viability) for both small- and large-scale fisheries (Fig 2a).  The net benefits contribution to society of the large-scale sector has decreased over time and since 2009 has fallen below zero. On the other hand, the contribution of the small-scale sector has increased, fallen and then has risen again more recently. The difference between economic and financial viability is much more visible in large-scale fisheries as they receive a much greater share of the subsidies compared to the small-scale sector (Fig 2a). This difference, furthermore, has been increasing over time with the increase in subsidies provided to LSF, especially to Pacific LSF (1f). Table 1) Results shown for the basic economic viability assessment of small- (SSF) and large-scale fisheries (LSF) averaged over the years 2000-2012 and presented in constant 2015 USD million.NationalPacificAtlanticBasic Economic ViabilityLSFSSFLSFSSFLSFSSFTotal Revenue7112,0115831,203128808Total Cost of fishing6781,9694581,124220845Subsidies1325112246104Financial viability16592246125-82-33Economic viability334212579-92-37Results of net benefits by region show a much more detailed picture of how net benefits are distributed by sector. Based on this basic economic viability assessment, averages over the 13 year study period show, SSF and LSF on the Atlantic are not economically nor financially viable, whereas both are on the Pacific (Table 1). It is interesting to see how across both regions both SSF and LSF average out to be economically viable on a national level (Table 1). The reason, I assume, is that the fishing sector on the Pacific is much larger, reflected, here, by its larger revenue and costs for both SSF and LSF (Table 1). However, the Atlantic as both SSF and LSF have been struggling to be economically viable, is in much need of attention to achieve economic viability. Analyzing results over time show that the small-scale sector as a total group has not been economically nor financially viable between the years 2000 and 2004, as net benefits both private and societal were negative (Fig 2a). Interestingly, after a period of positive economic viability (2004-2007), the net benefits to society dropped again below zero from 2007 to 2008, whereas financial viability maintained itself just above zero. This analysis suggests that the economic viability of small-scale fisheries has increased over time. Split into regions, trends for both Atlantic and Pacific SSF are generally increasing (Fig 2b). However, net benefits on the Atlantic are much lower than on the Pacific and have after a stretch of economic viability between 2005 and 2007 fallen below zero from 2007-2010. Fortunately, Atlantic SSF have been rising since 2010 and recovered into economic viability (Fig 2b). Figure 2)  Net benefits (NB) of Mexican small- (SSF) and large-scale fisheries (LSF) fisheries before (society) and after (private) subsidies on a national scale (a), disaggregated into Pacific and Atlantic regions for SSF (b) and LSF (c); presented in constant 2015 USD million.It is important to note that the rather stable price of fuel and the decrease in number of vessels in the small-scale sector are most likely the underlying factors for these trends (Table 1). These results are a good sign as, purely based on this study's economic viability analysis, the small-sale sector seems to be better prepared now than a few years ago, to possibly face some of their struggles, such as their vulnerability to a changing ecosystem. However, as many coastal communities depend on currently declining living marine resources  (Sala et al., 2004; Lluch-Cota et al., 2007; Finkbeiner, 2015) and this study only reflects a national and broader regional picture of the sector, it is important to further look into the details at local levels as there might be large differences and inequities within the small-scale sector (Cinti, 2010; Cinti et al., 2010; Basurto et al., 2012).The large-scale sector has until recently maintained positive net benefits, and only in 2009 started to generate negative net benefits, both private and societal (Fig 2a). The decrease in total revenue plus the increase in diesel costs over time has contributed to the increase in costs of the large-scale sector leading to the decline of economic and financial viability. Despite the fact that 83% of fuel subsidies are channeled to the large-scale sector (Lara and Guevara-Sangines, 2012), paid by the taxpayers, the net benefits on a national level have not made it back above zero (Fig 2a). However, when looking into the regions separately, results show how Pacific net benefits to the private sector for LSF have been increasing and financially viable over the 13 year study period despite a decrease from 2008 to 2010 (Fig 2c). Clearly, the large proportion of subsidies provided to Pacific LSF have made this possible as their economic viability has shown a decreasing trend and fallen below zero in 2012 (fig 2c). Atlantic LSF have not been neither economically not financially viable in most years and fallen below zero with a decreasing trend since 2007 (Fig 2c). Highlighting the years 2007 and 2008, it is interesting to see that despite receiving only a small fraction of fisheries subsidies, small-scale fisheries maintained net benefits to the private sector positive. The large-scale sector, on the other hand, received increasing amounts and shares of fisheries subsidies, reaching a maximum amount in 2008 (Fig 1c and f), their net benefits dropped below zero only 2 years later regardless (Fig 2a). Results also indicate that small-scale fisheries provide much higher net benefits to society during times of economic viability (see 2004-2005 and 2010-2012, Fig. 2a), compared to the large-scale sector, demonstrating their importance to society in Mexico. The net benefits of small-scale fisheries, however, show much higher variance over the years compared to their large-scale counterpart, which, on the other hand, could be due to their higher vulnerability to institutional, economic and environmental changes. Interestingly, LSF, on the other hand, depend on three main target species groups (sardine, shrimp and tuna), which makes them quite vulnerable to both market fluctuations and resource availability. This can be seen by the decline of economic viability over the last few years not only due to an increase in costs, but also a decrease in total revenue, for which the most likely reason is the decline in the price of shrimp, possibly due to its competition with aquaculture (see section 3.1 and pers communication E. Finkbeiner). 4. Policy and management implicationsTo better understand what the results of this study mean for small-scale fisheries, not just in Mexico, it is important to put this into the perspective of what is currently known about this sector, its challenges, vulnerabilities and also its opportunities. Small-scale fisheries have been described as opportunistic, where fishers would change their target species based on local abundance of the different commercially valued species, travel to different locations and use a variety of different fishing gear (Allison and Ellis, 2001; Salas et al., 2004; Aburto et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2009; Finkbeiner, 2015). These are important factors to be considered in the interpretation of the results of the economic viability assessment for SSF. In the case of Mexico, net benefits have been highly fluctuating over the 13 years, which possibly reflects their diversity and complexity. Currently, most Mexican small-scale fisheries are de facto open access, which has let to overcapacity, overfishing and ecosystem degradation, and the implementation of regulations has been suggested on both the Pacific and the Atlantic coasts (OECD, 2006b; Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013, 2016). Furthermore, recommendations for improved policy and management strategies, with a focus on implementing ecosystem-based as well as livelihood-based approaches have been made, not only for the small- but also the large-scale sector (Salas et al., 2007; Cinti et al., 2010; Cisneros-Mata, 2010; Erisman et al., 2011). An important example is to establish policies that give incentives toward fishing practices that are oriented towards increasing the added value and reducing impacts on the environment (Cisneros-Mata, 2010). Furthermore, managing fisheries based on their spatial distributions along the coastlines as well as emphasizing equitable fishing access rights and involving fishers in the decision making processes (Salas et al., 2007; Erisman et al., 2011). These recommendations are critical to improving economic viability of SSF and with it the sustainability of fisheries on ecosystem, social, economic and institutional levels. As results show, economic viability highly depends on the distribution of fisheries subsidies, total revenue and costs of fishing. Results of this study suggest that, for example, reduced fishing effort can lead to an increase in economic viability of Mexican small-scale fisheries (Fig 1d years 2009-2012) which is linked to improving the livelihoods of people who depend on marine resources. It is not an easy step to implement regulations, such as reducing fishing effort, in a place where hundreds of thousands of people depend on SSF and many fishers are marginalized from policy-processes. A possible redistribution of fishing effort, however, at least in some places will lead to more equity, as currently only few individuals hold the majority of fishing permits (Cinti et al., 2010; Basurto et al., 2012). There is a lack of communication with the federal fisheries agency, and often not enough funding is available from federal agencies to enable them to contribute adequately at the local scale (Cudney-Bueno and Basurto, 2009). Furthermore, inconsistent and sometimes contradictory policy directions have inhibited sustainable fisheries management, especially, for small-scale fisheries (Espinoza-Tenorio et al., 2011a). Finkbeiner and Basurto, (2015), however, suggest that Mexican fisheries should be governed for resilience suggesting a variety of feasible and realistic solutions which include the legal recognition of the small-scale fishing labor force. The authors also argued for more equitable access to fishing, which would directly lower illegal fishing and help enforce regulations. As currently a large percentage of fisheries in Mexico is unreported and illegal (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013), it is difficult to obtain information reflecting the real fishing effort and with it its costs and revenue to compute economic viability. Legal recognition and equitable access to resources would, therefore, improve the economic viability of Mexican small-scale fisheries. 5. Caveats and recommendationsDespite Mexico ranking quite high on the last OECD open government data review (OECD, 2016), there is still a lack of transparency concerning fisheries related information at the economic, social and institutional levels. The scarcity of data availability has caused a big challenge to gather sufficient and good quality data for this study. Similar findings have been reported previously, highlighting the importance of access to data, especially, concerning information on fisheries subsidies (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013, 2016). It is important that monitoring is improved to provide data with better resolution, accuracy and consistency (Erisman et al., 2011). Improving not only the access to data but also the quality, is essential to better our understanding of economic performance, viability and the well-being of coastal communities. Finding information on costs of fishing has been very difficult. The cost data publicly available are based on a few studies, however, it was not possible to come up with a realistic estimate by comparing results with either fishery specific or global level information  (Lam et al., 2011; Ramírez-Rodríguez and Almendárez-Hernández, 2013) Furthermore, finding enough information to make an accurate assessment over time has been challenging, e.g., government reports present the exact same number of small-scale boats for each year until 2009, which can hardly be true. However, at least these data exist and have provided a basis for a first economic viability analysis despite a few gaps (which were filled using simple statistical approaches). The results, despite a few caveats, can therefore be seen as the best science available on the economic viability of Mexican small- and large-scale fisheries over time. Mexican fisheries, as many other SSF worldwide, not only bring economic but also societal benefits to fishing communities. While acknowledging these cultural and social contributions, this economic viability assessment has not accounted for them. Therefore, it is important to, also understand other socio-economic drivers of economic viability. These include: the distribution of net benefits within the fishing communities; indirect and induced effects on society through fisheries (economic multiplier); employment; the degree of economic dependence on fishing; access to economics (e.g., financial services) and fish consumption and discard rates. Furthermore, while this analysis focuses on the differences between small- and large-scale fisheries as well as the two major regions, it does not look into more detailed differences within the small-scale sector, which would be another interesting analysis. There is no single accepted definition of SSF that applies worldwide because it is argued that SSF are too diverse and different from each other depending on the country and the oceans where they operate (Berkes et al., 2001; FAO et al., 2008; FAO, 2014). A similar argument could be made for small-scale fisheries on a national level in Mexico, as they are also very diverse and complex with each fishery having their own unique characteristics. However, at the same time, SSF all encounter very similar if not the same challenges, just to name a few: lack of cross-scale communication and support between local fishers and federal fisheries agencies; volatility in market prices; limited and unfair access to fishing rights; limited or no funding for monitoring and enforcement; changing oceanic conditions; receiving a much smaller fraction of fisheries subsidies compared to LSF; and decreasing marine resources (Sala et al., 2004; Salas et al., 2007; Bueno and Basurto, 2009; Cudney-Bueno and Basurto, 2009; Cinti et al., 2010; Cisneros-Mata, 2010), Chapter 3 of this thesis). It is therefore important to understand the economic viability on a national and wider regional level so these problems can be addressed by the federal fisheries agency for each fishing sector as a whole and not only for a few specific fisheries. Integrated approaches to ecosystem based management (human dimension included) in comparison to single species management have been promoted for many years to achieve sustainability on ecosystem, economic and social levels (e.g, (Velarde et al., 2004; Lluch-Cota et al., 2007; Arreguín-Sánchez and Arcos-Huitrón, 2011; Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2012; Fulton et al., 2014). Policies to foster ecosystem based approaches need to focus on whole areas rather than on specific fisheries, therefore, understanding the economic viability as a whole of the different sectors and areas, follows along the same line.Based on this study's results, direct recommendations to improve economic viability of Mexican fisheries are the following: 1. The inequity of subsidy distribution has been increasing over time mainly benefiting the Pacific LSF, this inequity is visible not only between sectors but also between regions. As shown in many other studies at global and national levels (e.g., (Schorr, 2005; Sumaila et al., 2010; Charles, 2011; Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2016), subsidies are in need of reform and capacity-enhancing types urgently need to be reduced. 2. Financial support should focus on monitoring and enforcement on a local scale where currently funds are scarce. This would not only fight illegal and unreported fishing but also improve the quality of economic viability assessments. 3. Active small-scale vessels need to be accurately monitored and it is important to assess how many people depend on fishing for their livelihoods, this is an integral part to make management suggestions that could improve economic viability, such as redistributing access rights (Saavedra-Díaz et al., 2016). With this information, ways can be found to maintain fishing effort at a sustainable level, which would not only benefit the marine ecosystem but also the economic viability of the fishing communities. Improved economic viability, therefore, would help improve food security, alleviate poverty and undernourishment in coastal fishing communities.6. ConclusionsAs this is the first study that has analyzed economic viability of small-scale fisheries on a national and regional level, it would be interesting to repeat this assessment in other countries and on a global scale. This will help bridge the current knowledge gap in small-scale fisheries research and help elevate their profile to address poverty alleviation in coastal communities all across the world. Results show how important it is to analyze small- and large-scale fisheries separately to really address the needs of each fishing sector as they are very different from each other, not only on a national level but also comparing different regions. Economic viability an often broadly used term, however, simply defined here to highlight the differences between benefits to society versus the private sector from fishing, with subsidies being the key distortion. Governments often have the tendency to promote and justify the use of fisheries subsidies to help the poor and maintain employment. However, our analysis shows that the majority of those subsidies are given to Pacific large, industrial fisheries not to support the already marginalized coastal communities, this bias clearly undermines the chance of all sectors in both regions to achieve economic viability. Extended economic viability and socio-economic attributes of small- and large-scale fisheries; an example from Mexico1. IntroductionBasic economic viability has been defined as in achieving nonnegative net benefits to society from fishing (Schuhbauer and Sumaila, 2016) and assessed on a national level using Mexican fisheries as an example in Chapter 4. Here, I will extend the basic formula of economic viability and I aim to broaden the assessment of economic viability of small-scale fisheries by defining and including a set of economic and socio-economic attributes. The following objectives will be addressed: 1. Identify, define and measure economic and socio-economic attributes regarded important to the economic viability of fisheries; 2. Assess the results of the measured attributes and their possible impact on economic viability; 3. Analyze what the results mean for sustainable fisheries policies and management.Small-scale fisheries, which play in integral part in global fisheries and support millions of livelihoods are threatened by anthropogenic changes such as overfishing and climate change (Cheung et al., 2008, 2009; Costello et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2001; Srinivasan et al., 2010; Sumaila et al., 2011). Considering ecosystem, social, economic and institutional dimensions of small-scale fisheries has been identified as essential when it comes to developing policies towards sustainable ocean and coastal management (Allison and Ellis, 2001; Chuenpagdee, 2011; Pomeroy and Andrew, 2011). Furthermore, it has been recognized that quantitative measures alone are not sufficient to understand how to achieve sustainable policies, but instead, values, agency and inequality should be core measures (Hicks et al., 2016). A variety of socio-economic indicators and frameworks to model the interactions of human activity and the marine environment have been developed over the last decades (e.g., (Bowen and Riley, 2003; Charles, 1991; Cheung and Sumaila, 2008; Eisenack, 2003; Gasalla et al., 2010). These are important to address the need to more comprehensively understand the underlying dynamic and complexities of small-scale fisheries (e.g., Isaacs, 2011; Jentoft et al., 2011). Fortunately, the importance of socio-economics of small-scale fisheries is being increasingly recognized all over the world (e.g., (Charles, 1991; Chuenpagdee, 2011; Gasalla et al., 2010; McConney and Charles, 2008; Teh et al., 2011; Ünal and Franquesa, 2010). It has been a challenge, with the current state of knowledge and data availability, to implement recommendations provided by socio-economic studies into fisheries policy making (Cudney-Bueno and Basurto, 2009; Mora et al., 2009; Symes and Hoefnagel, 2010; Usseglio et al., 2014). Methodologies such as the sustainable livelihood approach, the welfare function and the wealth-based approach have all been developed, suggested and discussed in the literature to achieve sustainable management of fisheries to find ways to secure livelihoods achieve food security in small-scale fishing communities (Allison and Ellis, 2001; Béné et al., 2010; Cunningham et al., 2009; Schuhbauer and Sumaila, 2016). Vulnerability in the sense of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, as well as food security have been identified as key to protecting threatened fisheries communities whose livelihoods depend on marine fisheries (Béné et al., 2007; Hicks et al., 2016; McClanahan et al., 2013; Pauly et al., 2005; Srinivasan et al., 2010). For example, McClanahan et al. (2013) measures sensitivity in the context of fisheries by the degree of human dependence on marine resources for food, revenue and income. Teh and Sumaila (2013), argue that it is essential for sustainable fisheries management to know the numbers of people involved directly and indirectly in the fishing sector. However, often, employment in the sector is not well reflected in official statistics, which is especially important to the SSF sector whose work is often not part of the formal sector and include work of women and children who are not usually counted (Harper et al., 2013; Teh and Sumaila, 2013). The importance of an industry in the economy of a country is usually measured in terms of their contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), however, this brings some caveats in regards to small-scale fisheries. First, percentage of GDP accounts for the added value of the fishery but not necessarily for the total economic impact, and second small-scale fisheries are not always represented completely as their catches are often not reported comprehensively in official catch statistics (Dyck and Sumaila, 2010; Teh et al., 2011; Zeller et al., 2006). Therefore, to assess the economic contribution from fishing to society it is not sufficient to only consider the direct output from fishing expressed in gross revenue or profit. More impacts such as indirect and induced impacts, should be considered also. Understanding the economic viability of small-scale fisheries is relevant as it will bring attention to the existing problems encountered by these fisheries (Schuhbauer and Sumaila, 2016 and Chapter 4). Various studies reported in the literature call for the inclusion of socio-economic attributes into the assessment of a fishery's economic viability (Adeogun et al., 2009; Baumgärtner and Quaas, 2009; Lery et al., 1999; Schuhbauer and Sumaila, 2016). As results from Chapter 4 suggest, Mexican small-scale fisheries have been economically viable since 2009. It should be noted that the main distortion assumed between economic viability and net benefits to the private sector are fisheries subsidies. As subsidies are paid by the taxpayers, their influence on the net benefits from fishing are essential. However, as economic viability depends on many variables and attributes, it is challenging to find out which are the main drivers that make a fishery economically viable or not. Mexico is used as an example to illustrate how this assessment can be done. The reason Mexico was chosen is because it reflects a typical developing country in terms of fisheries encompassing a large small-scale fisheries sector, which employs hundreds of thousands of people spread along the coastlines. Furthermore, a first economic viability assessment on a national level has been carried out already, which is used as a basis here (Chapter 4). In the following method section, after identifying and defining key attributes, I will introduce Mexico's fisheries as the case study and then describe in detail how each attribute is being assessed and analyzed and what that means for making sustainable fisheries policies.2. Methods2.1 Attributes of economic viabilityAs mentioned in the introduction, economic viability is defined as nonnegative net benefits to society from fishing over time, financial viability on the other hand are net benefits to the private sector from fishing over time. The method to compute net benefits is described in detail in Chapter 4 of this thesis. To be able to bring the economic viability into a broader perspective and extend its assessment, it is necessary to look into more than just economic drivers. Therefore, integrating socio-economic attributes into the analysis is the goal for this chapter. After a thorough literature review and several consultations with scientists with economic, social, governance and ecological expertise in SSF within the Too Big To Ignore (TBTI) partnership, including a workshop (Too Big To Ignore, 2014), I selected a set of key economic and socio-economic attributes (Table 1). These attributes can be useful for both: a global and a case-study level. The selection criteria include relevance, availability, measurability, and objectivity, i.e., whether the same result is obtained when the attribute is measured by different scientists at different times (Boyd and Charles, 2006).Table 1) List of attributes included in the extended economic viability assessment of small- and large-scale fisheries, their definitions and how they can be assessed.Nº AttributesDefinitionSources and measures1Proportion of SSF to LSF landing and landed value (%)The ratio of SSF and LSF landings and revenue to total landings and total revenue of the whole fishery.For national numbers see data from Sea Around Us and FERU. For case studies check literature, e.g., government reports and/or conduct surveys. 2Cost structure (ratio)Cost structure is the ratio of fixed costs (e.g., capital investment) to variable costs (e.g., fuel, labor).For national numbers see Lam et al., (2011). For case studies check literature, e.g., government reports and/or conduct surveys.3Cost per tonne of catchCost divided per tonne of catch, useful when comparing different fisheries and countries.For national numbers see Lam et al., (2011). For case studies check literature, e.g., government reports and/or conduct surveys.4Multiplier (factor)Describes indirect income (income multiplier) and induced effects on society (economic multiplier) through fisheries. A multiplier is a factor by which we can multiply the value of final demand for an economic activity’s output to obtain its total contribution to economic output including activities directly and indirectly dependent on it. For national numbers see Dyck and Sumaila (2010)For cae studies adjust the national multipliers (both income and economic multipliers) either using reports and/or surveys.5Employment (#)Number jobs highlights the contribution of fisheries employment including both commercial and subsistence marine SSF. Employment type describes how a worker is employed. For example, the International Labor Organization (ILO) classifications are: employees, employers, own-account workers, members or producer cooperatives, contributing family workers, workers not classifiable by status. These can be adjusted to fisheries (e.g., boat owner, paid by catch share, employed by a company/cooperative).For national numbers see (Teh and Sumaila, 2013), ILO and FAO.For case studies review FAO, government reports and carry out surveys (government agencies, NGOs and/or fishers). 6Subsidy intensity (ratio)A measure of equity among different groups in society or a community in regard to the distribution of subsidies. Compute ratio of total subsidies per fishing sector to either number of fishers, landed value or fisheries landings. For national numbers see Chapter 3 of this thesis, Teh and Sumaila, 2013 and Sea Around Us data.For case studies review FAO, government reports and carry out surveys (government agencies, NGOs and/or fishers). 7Fisheries discards (%)How much of total catch is being discarded at sea compared to landed at the ports.For national numbers see FAO and Sea Around Us database.For case studies check literature, e.g., government reports; conduct surveys; and monitor the catch.8Catch not used for direct human consumption (%)The amount of landings that are used directly for human consumption compared to indirect human consumption (e.g., fodder for livestock) and industrial use (e.g, beauty products).For both national numbers and case-studies see FAO and literature, e.g., government reports and carry out surveys (government agencies, NGOs and/or fishers). 2.2 Case study: Mexican fisheriesTo illustrate how the key attributes (Table 1) are assessed and analyzed with the goal of better understanding possible drivers of economic viability, I choose Mexico as a case-study. For the definition of Mexican small-scale fisheries (SSF) see Chapter 4 of this thesis. SSF are distributed widely along all Mexican coastlines and target different fish and invertebrate species. Some fishing communities are well organized such as lobster and abalone fisheries in the North Pacific area, whereas others are found isolated from markets and marginalized from policy processes (Cinti et al., 2010; Cota-Nieto et al., 2015; Salas et al., 2011). Declining resources, vulnerability to climate change, high dependency of fishing for livelihoods, poverty and inequities regarding access rights, however, are very common threats faced by most Mexican SSF across the country (e.g., Dickinson et al., 2006; Finkbeiner, 2015; Morzaria-Luna et al., 2014; Salas et al., 2007). Large-scale fisheries (LSF) mainly target shrimp, tuna and sardine on the Pacific. On the Atlantic side the fisheries focus mainly on finfish and shrimp (Conapesca, 2013; Fernández et al., 2011).2.3. Analyzing attributesThe attributes presented in Table 1 have been selected to describe the extended economic viability assessment which broadens the basic economic viability assessment presented in Chapter 4. Here, I analyze these attributes (1-8 in Table 1), at a national and regional level; regions are the Pacific and the Atlantic coasts of Mexico. I use annual data and also calculate averages from the years 2000-2012 where available. Where no complete data sets were available, information is taken from the most recent years. All amounts are converted into constant 2015 USD. See following sections for a detailed description of each attribute and its data sources.2.3.1. Proportion of landings and total revenueSources for the data are taken from Mexican catch reconstruction (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013) and averaged (2000-2010) to estimate the percentages of total landing (total catch – discards) of SSF and LSF as well as per region (Pacific and Atlantic). I used reconstructed total revenue data from Chapter 4 based on Cisneros-Montemayor et al., (2013), FAO statistics and CONAPESCA annual reports for 2000-2010 to calculate the proportions of total revenue by sector and region. 2.3.2. Cost structureThe total cost of fishing and the cost structure may vary depending on the fishing gear and vessel type. The reader is referred to Chapter 4 for a detailed description of the cost and cost structure estimates for Mexican small- and large-scale fisheries from 2000-2012. In summary, data for variable costs (fuel, labor and running costs) and fixed costs (depreciation and interest) were reconstructed using various data of either a single fishery and/or individual fishing units. The results were then scaled up to national and regional levels using fishing effort data (number of boats and fishers) per fishing sector and/or fishery for Atlantic and Pacific coasts (Agroprospecta, 2010; Conapesca, 2013; Greer, 2014; Ramírez-Rodríguez and Almendárez-Hernández, 2013). 2.3.3. Cost per tonne of catchTo be able to compare costs of fishing across the sectors and regions I calculated the cost of fishing per tonne of catch. Here, I used reconstructed cost data from Chapter 4 of both SSF and LSF from the Atlantic and the Pacific and divided them by tonnes of catch using data from Cisneros-Montemayor et al. (2013). As reconstructed catch data are only available until 2010, I averaged cost per tonne of catch using the years 2000-2010.2.3.4. Economic impact To measure the total economic impact of Mexican small- and large-scale fisheries, it is important to look beyond the landed value that each fishery produces and estimate the direct, indirect and induced impact from fishing on the economy. Direct impact is considered all money spent by fishers to carry out fishing (e.g. boats, motors, paint, fuel etc.). Indirect impact refers to the impact arising from purchased inputs, spent by the sellers of goods they sold to the fishers (e.g. equipment needs to be bought to sell fuel, produce nets, catch bait etc.). Induced impact considers the effects and impacts that are induced by consumer spending from income received either through direct or indirect activities of fishing which creates a broader demand in the economy. When these impacts are added together it reflects the total impact of fishing on a country's economy. To quantify these impacts an input-output model is usually used. In this case the model has already been built (Dyck and Sumaila, 2010), and national values for Mexico have been estimated. However, not enough information is available to split economic impact results into regions and fishing sector. Fortunately, the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) provided data for the year 2008, which include total revenue from fishing and the total added value, together these produce the total economic impact from fishing. INEGI data are available by municipality, however, not by fishing sector. As Mexican large-scale fisheries focus on a few species whose landings are concentrated at a few ports (Erisman et al., 2011; FAO, 2003), I decided to use the data of municipalities where the large-scale fishing ports are located to estimate the economic multiplier for large-scale fisheries. The ports include: Ensenada, Comondú, Manzanillo, Tapachula, Mazatlán, Guaymas and Progreso. Most of the processing plants of the LSF sector are located in these municipalities with about 80% of all plants of the Pacific found in the Gulf of California, where on the Atlantic side almost 50% of the processing plants are found in Progreso, Yucatan (FAO, 2003). Data from all other coastal municipalities was used to estimate the economic multiplier for small-scale fisheries as SSF are found spread along the coastlines with various landing sites. The multiplier was then used to estimate the total economic impact using landed value data reconstructed for 2000-2012 (Chapter 4) based on data from (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013; Conapesca, 2013).2.3.5 EmploymentThe number of people employed in fisheries and number of dependents accounted for here can be direct and indirect. Direct employment includes all people who fish, this includes men, women and children as well as encompasses all fishing activities, whether they happen from the shore e.g., collecting invertebrates, or fishing from a boat. Indirect employment includes people engaged in the post-harvest sector, any processing and selling of the catch. Data made available by INEGI 2008 shows the most complete number of people who work in the fishing sector, as done through population census which very likely capture the informal sector also. These data also include numbers of people engaged in fishing who are employed versus self-employed and number of people who have health benefits compared to those who don't. Information from annual fisheries reports (Conapesca, 2013) show number of fisher combined in aquaculture and fisheries as a total national value and per region (Atlantic and Pacific), illegal and informal fishers are probably not captured here. To disaggregate the number by fishing sector I used the number of active fishing vessels and average number of crew per type of fishery from official statistics to estimate the reported number of fishers active in each fishery. Then I used the fraction of unreported to reported catch data to reconstruct the number of total fishers per sector aimed to cover numbers of both licensed and unlicensed fishers. 2.3.6 Subsidy intensityThe term subsidy intensity is used here based on (Sumaila et al., 2010) to express the measure of the amount of subsidies by total revenue. Furthermore, I compute subsidies per fisher to better understand inequity in the subsidies distribution to the two sectors and regions. The reason I choose not only subsidies by total revenue but also by number of fisher is to better reflect the impact on actual people involved in fishing in comparison to number of firms or boats. It needs to be clarified, especially for fishers employed in the LSF, that the resulting amounts do not reflect what each fisher actually receives, but more likely instead what the company receives or saves in costs as subsidies. However, the main goal here is to show the inequity in subsidy distribution more in general on a socio-economic perspective as well as to have a more standardized way to compare fishing sector and regions. 2.3.7. Fisheries discardsThe ratio of discards to landings from small- and large-scale fisheries is an essential aspect in relation to food security and poverty. In a country such as Mexico where millions of people suffer from undernourishment (Olaiz-Fernandez et al., 2006), it is important to look closely into how much fishery products are being wasted at sea not only for economic efficiency and wasted food but also for ecosystem health aspects. This analysis was possible due to catch reconstruction data that indicate whether the catch was landed or discarded disaggregated into fishing sector and region (Pacific and Atlantic) (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013). 2.3.8. Fish for human consumptionIt is interesting to see how much of the actual landings are directly used for human consumption in comparison to animal fodder (agri- and aquaculture) as well as for industrial use (e.g. beauty products).  Official Mexican fisheries reports indicate what percentage of landings is used for either direct human consumption, indirect human consumption (e.g. animal fodder) and industrial use, also shown separated by sector and region (Conapesca, 2013).3. Results and discussionAs shown Chapter 4, using the basic economic viability formula, both the small- and large-scale sectors can be considered economically viable on average over the years 2000-2012. However, showing the averages per region, both SSF and LSF on the Atlantic (Table 2), are not economically viable as net benefits to society are negative, whereas both are economically viable on the Pacific.Table 2) Results shown from the basic and extended economic viability assessment for Mexican small- (SSF) and large-scale fisheries (LSF).NationalPacificAtlanticLSFSSFLSFSSFLSFSSFBasic economic viability (USD in million)334212579-92-37Extended Economic Viability1.

Proportions of landings and total revenueResults of the proportions of fisheries landings show that the LSF on a national level catches almost half of the total catch (48%), whereas that reflects only about a quarter of the total revenue (26%). This clearly shows that the SSF receives much higher prices for each tonne of fish caught on average. When breaking the results down into the regions the same pattern can be observed even more clearly on the Pacific, with LSF taking 60% of total catch 33% of the total revenue. On the Atlantic, the trend is quite different as LSF only take 9% of the total catch but 15% of total revenue. To find out possible reasons for this, I looked into change of prices per tonne of catch over the years and found a large drop in shrimp prices and an increase in price for anchovies, sardines and tuna between 2006 and 2007. As the LSF on the Atlantic largely depend on shrimp fisheries this drop in price has led to a large drop in total revenue, leading to a very low average of total revenue over the observed years. With increasing prices of anchovies, sardines and tuna the total revenue of LSF on the Pacific are increasing over time, therefore, the gap between the two regions' total revenue is increasing over time.3.2 CostsResults on a national level show that costs are much higher for SSF compared to LSF when divided by tonne of catch (Table 2). However, Atlantic LSF have a much higher cost per tonne of catch looking into results by region and sector. Fuel consumption is the largest cost of fishing (Fig 1) and with rising diesel prices (Chapter 4) the cost per boat has been increasing for both sectors and regions. However, a drastic drop in catches of the Atlantic LSF by about half between 2000-2010, along with only a very slight decrease in number of boats (by 10%) the cost per tonne of catch has increased drastically by over 60% from 2000-2012.Based on our estimates in regard to the cost structure, the percentage of cost of fuel is much higher in SSF, almost half of the total costs of fishing (Fig. 1). Labor is the second largest. As fuel costs take such a large component for SSF, fuel efficiency is an important factor for the small-scale fisheries, which almost exclusively use outboard gasoline powered engines. Fixed costs and running costs take a larger fraction within the LSF costs compared to SSF, for both regions. The fact that fixed costs are higher in LSF compared to SSF (11 and 4%, respectively) reflects that LSF vessels have a much larger initial investment, furthermore most SSF boats and gear are much older compared to many boats in LSF (Conapesca, 2013). Figure 1) Total cost of fishing shown by cost structure divided into fixed and variable (labor, repair and running, fuel) costs, by small- (SSF) and large-scale fisheries (LSF) in percentages.Small-scale fisheries are often not as profit oriented as large-scale and their initial investment is lower, most of them are owner-operated and labor costs can easily make up for a third of total cost of fishing. However, this is not necessary a real cost as often the  fishing crew consists of family members or close friends who will get a share of the catch rather than a salary. Large-scale fishers on the other hand have crews from 10 to up to over 100 people per vessel, which often are being paid a salary regardless of any fish being caught. The argument could be made here that LSF therefore bring more job security as long as fishery is financially viable, however, lower percent of labor in LSF (Fig 1) might indicate lower payments than in SSF. 3.3 Economic impactData used to estimate multipliers to capture the economic impact from Mexican fisheries were taken from all coastal municipalities. Atlantic SSF are estimated to have the highest multiplier, however, at the same time not very high revenue and therefore less economic impact that Pacific SSF (Fig 2). Small-scale fisheries on the Pacific with the second largest multiplier have the largest total impact from fishing (Fig 2). The lowest multiplies is found from Atlantic LSF, which also bring the lowest total revenue, and therefore, has by far the lowest economic impact from fishing. Figure 2) Total economic impact from Mexican fisheries shown by small- (SSF) and large-scale fisheries (LSF) shown as total revenue from fishing plus added value. The economic multiplier assessed by Dyck and Sumaila (2010) for Mexico is 1.72, however, it was not possible to separate this data into sectors or regions. I therefore used data made available by the Mexican Institute for statistics and geography (INEGI 2008), the economic multiplier for small-scale fisheries was estimated at 1.5 for large-scale and 1.59 for small-scale fisheries. The reason for the lower multiplier is very probable that induced effects are not accounted for in the available data, however, as this is the only data available that made it possible to divide the economic impact by sector and region, it is useful as a first estimate as well as to compare regions and sector.  3.4 EmploymentBased on Teh and Sumaila (2013) estimates for direct and indirect employment for Mexican fisheries are around 750 thousand people. Based on 2012 reported numbers there are in total 185 thousand people active in fisheries in Mexico (Conapesca, 2013) and about 340 thousand occupied in the fishing sector which to some extend includes indirect employment (INEGI 2008). However, as rightfully argued in Teh and Sumaila (2013), official statistics rarely capture people in the small-sector, especially those in remote places, the ones part of the informal sector and women. The results of my reconstructed number of fishers is therefore almost double the number of reported active fishers (339 thousand), using reported and unreported catch data from Mexican catch reconstruction (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2013). To account for indirect employment also, I calculated a multiplier using reported numbers (1.8) and applied it to the reconstructed active fishers. I estimate that another 288 thousand people are occupied indirectly in fisheries for the year 2012. The total number of people who depend on fisheries for their employment is therefore 627 thousand, which is very close to what Teh and Sumaila (2013) estimated using a global model. Reconstructed number of fishers in Mexico by region shows the lowest number of people working in the Pacific LSF, despite them making up for almost half of Mexican total catch. However, most people working in fisheries are found within the Pacific SSF. The Atlantic sector is quite a bit smaller, however, the total estimate for Atlantic fishers is 146,000. As both SSF and LSF based on the Atlantic are, based on Chapter 4, not economically viable, it is important to understand that whichever management is being suggested to rectify this, will have to make sure that not only livelihoods of these fishers are being considered but also people indirectly employed in fisheries. 3.5 Subsidy intensityComputed subsidy intensity expressed in amount of subsidy per fisher shows on a national level that a large-scale fisher would receive 24 times more support than a small-scale fisher over the 13 years of the study period. Although Pacific SSF receive more subsidies than Atlantic LSF (Chapter 4 Fig 1f), when looking into subsidy intensity, the Atlantic LSF receives much more subsidies per total revenue and per fisher. Furthermore, subsidy intensity (subsidy/total revenue) of Atlantic LSF has been increasing drastically, simultaneously with the drop in total revenue in 2006. Though, it seems that the government support has been reduced with Atlantic LSF not being economically viable shown by decreasing subsidies since 2006 (Chapter 4 Fig 1f). Fig 3) Subsidy intensity shown in subsidies per total revenue and subsidies per fisher from 2000-2012 for small- (SSF) and large-scale fisheries (LSF) of Mexico divided into Atlantic and Pacific regions. Pacific LSF receiving the largest share of subsidies, shows subsidy intensity steadily increasing over the years, both per fisher and per total revenue. Economic viability of Pacific LSF has dropped since 2007, whereas subsidies continued to increase strongly, enough to keep financial viability positive while economic viability had already declined below zero in 2012 (Chapter 4 Fig 2c). This is interesting, as the question arises why the government decides to support the Pacific LSF with increasing subsidies, whereas it seems not to do the same for Atlantic LSF. 3.6 Fisheries discardsResults indicate that LSF have a much higher discard rate (Fig 4), whereas the small-scale sector lands most of their catch (Fig 4). However, despite that Atlantic LSF have the lowest total catch when divided by sector and region they have the highest discard rate at 47% on average over the study period. Also, SSF on the Atlantic have a slightly higher discard rate than Pacific SSF (10 and 7%, respectively).Fig 4) Total catch divided into landings and discards from 2000-2010 for small- (SSF) and large-scale fisheries of Mexico shown by Pacific and Atlantic regions. Possible reasons for the large discrepancies between the sectors are that SSF use their catch for home consumption, even if fish are too small to sell. Furthermore, SSF use more passive gear like traps often quite selective. LSF on the other hand work with large trawlers, and especially industrial shrimp fishery is known to be prone to large bycatch and discard rates (Shepherd and Myers, 2005). 3.7 Fish for human consumptionOut of the total landings from SSF and LSF combined, 56.5% is for human consumption, 43% for indirect human consumption (mainly fish meal for animal fodder) and 0.5% for industrial use (e.g., beauty products). But when split into the sectors on a national level 42% from LSF whereas 100% of the SSF catch is for direct human consumption.  Out of the total catch 99% from total Atlantic fisheries, and 50% from total Pacific fisheries is for direct human consumption. As 100% of total catch from SSF is exclusively used for direct human consumption, percentages per sector for each region shift, i.e., out of total Atlantic LSF 94% and 40% of Pacific LSF is aimed at direct human consumption, respectively. 4. Extended economic viability - synopsisIn summary, economic viability of fisheries, based on our results, seems to be most strongly influenced by the following attributes, fuel efficiency, price of fish which mainly depends on whether fish is sold for direct human consumption or not and discard rates. Here, I will bring the results from all attributes measured together to analyze them in light of basic economic viability results and compare them among sectors and regions. Small-scale fisheries on a national level show increasing economic viability over time with a positive average over the analyzed years (Table 2 and Chapter4 Fig 2a). Total revenue compared to total landings of SSF indicate higher prices compared to the LSF. The number of people employed directly and indirectly is quite high as well as the total economic impact measured using the multiplier. This shows the importance of SSF to society in Mexico, which indicates, with increasing economic viability over the studied years, a positive perspective into the future. Besides, SSF have quite low discard rates, which is positive for both the environment, as less (often juvenile) fish get unnecessarily taken, and for economic efficiency, as less discards means lower costs for the same amount of landings (Crowder and Murawski, 1998). Furthermore, all of the fish is used for human consumption, which is important for food security within coastal rural communities, where people depend on seafood for protein intake. On the other hand, SSF operate at very high costs per tonne of catch and high fuel costs, which make up for almost half their expenses, showing that boats do not run very efficiently. To highlight a few difference between the SSF on the Pacific and the Atlantic, it is important to point out that Atlantic SSF have not been economically viable on average (Table 2). However, when observing their changes over time, the perspective is less grim with positive and increasing economic viability since 2011. Based on this analysis, reasons for the Atlantic being less viable than the Pacific could be that Atlantic SSF have lower fisheries landings per boat with numbers decreasing, higher discard rates and catches have been decreasing whereas increasing on the Pacific. This would mean fishing effort is too high for the amount of marine resources available. Large-scale fisheries on a national level show positive economic viability on average (Table 2), however, economic viability has been decreasing steadily since 2007 and has fallen below zero since 2009 (Chapter 4 Fig 2a). However, as differences between the Atlantic and the Pacific regions are quite eminent, I will directly look into each region individually as well as compare them to each other and their SSF counterpart. Pacific LSF are on average economically viable, however, have been decreasing since 2007 and fallen below zero in 2012. They operate at very low costs per tonne of catch, which is positive for their economic viability. Additionally, Pacific LSF seem much more fuel efficient, as fuel take less of a proportion in their total costs than within SSF, which can be positive for the environment if operating within sustainable levels of resource exploitation. Looking into fisheries subsidies, Pacific LSF receive the largest fraction with the subsidy amounts increasing over time. However, despite subsidies largely increasing the fisheries' financial viability, they do not seem to have a long term effect on their economic viability, as both financial and economic viable have been on a decreasing trend since 2007 (Chapter 4 Fig 2c). A large percentage of LSF landings, especially on the Pacific coast is not destined for direct human consumption but mostly for fish meal production, creating economic output in cities like Guaymas (Pacific) or El Progreso (Atlantic). Knowing that most fish and seafood production companies are accumulated in only a few areas where LSF operate (FAO, 2003), I would have expected these areas to reflect higher economic multipliers and therefore higher economic impacts in both Atlantic and Pacific regions. Mainly, because I assumed the more post fisheries production is carried out the higher the economic impact would be. However, the contrary is true as the larger multipliers are found in areas where mainly SSF operate and where 100% of the fish landed is not only used for direct human consumption but also mostly sold fresh to the end consumer. Furthermore, LSF in general only employ a very small fraction of total fishers which is highlighted by the very large subsidy intensity when analyzing subsidy per fisher, again, showing unfair distribution of subsidies, as SSF have a much higher economic impact and employ many more people, directly and indirectly (see also Chapter 4). Discards in LSF are much higher than in SSF, which is of concern for their economic viability as well as for ecosystem sustainability as explained above. Prices for landings seem to play a crucial role for the decreasing economic viability, with decreasing shrimp prices and increasing competition with shrimp aquaculture, Pacific LSF seem to try to make up for decreasing total revenue by catching tuna and sardine. Sardine, however, is mainly caught for fish meal and fish feed production and does not yield much profit. Atlantic LSF, show a much worse perspective, as they are not economically viable on average (Table 2), their economic viability has been very low for the entire study period and negative since 2006 (Chapter 4 Fig 2c). While Pacific LSF have very low costs per tonne of catch on average, Atlantic LSF have a much larger cost. Reasons for this, might be their very low catches per boat and decreasing total catches (compared to increasing catches by Pacific LSF). One huge concern here is the large amount of discards, Atlantic LSF throw almost half of their catch back overboard which creates waste, degrades the marine ecosystem, impacts food security and jeopardizes economic viability due to increase in cost of fishing. Furthermore, Atlantic LSF do not only have the lowest total revenue compared to other regions and sector, but also the lowest economic multiplies, leading to a very small total economic impact. Results clearly indicate that there is lots of room for improving Pacific LSF economic viability, however, Atlantic LSF are in urgent need for attention from the Mexican government, as continuing at this rate, people soon will be out of their jobs and the already threatened marine ecosystem will rapidly degrade.4. Recommendations how to improve economic viabilityWhen studying small-scale fisheries specifically, culture, values and community should be in the focus when establishing policies and management regulation. This is challenging especially in places where small-scale fisheries are politically marginalized. However, using results from this study I will present a set of key recommendation to Mexican fisheries policy makers and managers both on a regional and federal level that I believe can improve economic viability of both SSF and LSF. Monitoring of active boats and fishers needs to be improved and up-dated regularly, the fact that costs per tonne are extremely high and catch per vessel very low for Atlantic LSF might be due to an over-representation of active fishing vessels. This largely influences not only the outcome of the basic but also the extended economic viability assessment. Besides, improved on board monitoring for both SSF and LSF will help improve fishing technologies to reduce discards rates. Discards often comprise of juvenile fish, their protection will improve ecosystem health in already overfished areas, this and a reduction in cost due to better technology will improve economic viability. That such a large component of fisheries landings is not used for direct human consumption (60%) is of great concern on various levels. First, economic viability of LSF could be in much better shape if their landings were sold for similar prices on average as they are in SSF, this would achieve a much higher output and not as much fish needs to be caught to yield higher profitability. Obviously, this needs to be monitored and regulated to make sure higher profits will not result in higher catches. Sardines and anchovies, the main target fish used for fish meal and fish feed production could be marketed for human consumption instead, this will yield higher profits and help local food security. While small pelagic fish are very nutritious they are also more affordable in comparison to, for example, larger pelagic or reef fish. This has been argued in many places already, especially where undernourishment and food security are prevalent issues in coastal communities (Alder et al., 2008; Tacon and Metian, 2009). Furthermore, arguments have been made that leaving more sardines in the ocean as forage fish, which play crucial roles in marine ecosystems, will lead to greater fisheries profitability in the long term (Hannesson et al., 2009). The same argument can be made here for economic viability not only for Pacific LSF but also with increased ecosystem health due to healthier forage stocks, other fisheries (such as Pacific SSF) will directly benefits also.If SSF could improve their fuel efficiency they would lower their costs of fishing drastically. This would be beneficial for the environment, as modern more energy efficient equipment increases efficiency and decreases pollution. Although SSF already operate with rather low discard rates, better equipment might also help reducing by-catch rates even further. Lower costs, healthier ecosystems and higher efficiency will improve economic viability. Here, a recommendation could be to instead of supplying SSF with new outboard gasoline powered engines, which is currently part of Mexico's subsidies policy, policies should be made with long term goals in mind and help fisher access financing to be able to afford more efficient and environmentally friendly technologies. Although this would lead to an increase in fixed costs due to a higher initial investment, however, it would not only decrease fuel costs but also maintenance and other running cost, due to less problems with newer engines, which need less frequent repairs. It is important to note that this would only work if the current open access regime was regulated to avoid an increase in fishing effort motivated by increasing profits.Again, as pointed out clearly in earlier chapters of this thesis, subsidies are a main concern, as unfairly distributed and while making Pacific LSF financially viable they definitely do not show a positive impact on the fisheries’ economic viability. SSF on both coasts clearly employ many more people and contribute to a larger extend to the total economic impact from fishing than LSF, however, subsidies are continued to increase only to Pacific LSF whose economic viability is in decline. Therefore, policies on fisheries subsidies are in urgent need of reform. Differences not only between sectors abut also between regions call for not only for improved policies on a federal level but also better local oriented fisheries management.5. Caveats and conclusionsData availability is the main limiting factor here. It would have been interesting to carry out a cluster analysis, principal component analysis or a general linear model to better understand the relationship among the different attributes as well as their relation to economic viability statistically. However, as we have maximum one data point per year, sector and region and often even less, such statistical analyses cannot be applied here. Nonetheless, this Chapter as the extended viability analysis has more a descriptive focus, as it is the first of its kind, trends and dynamics of these attributes clearly help us understand underlying mechanism and possible drivers of economic viability. Once more data can be gathered, possibly on a local level, statistical analysis will be much more helpful to interpret data patterns and trends. Factors that influence economic viability such as discard rates and whether fish is used for direct human consumption or not seem to be key factors when it comes to issues such as food security and ecosystem health as well. Results show that by better understanding the economic viability of fisheries we also touch on other ecosystem and social aspects which are important to understand to achieve a balanced fisheries management. Conclusionsxiv 38
